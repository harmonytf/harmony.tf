It will be long and not as sensational as the RedTape’s PDF, but it aims to give people the actual facts and story, rather than to stir up some cheap drama.</p><p>We will provide the context for every screenshot included, some of it going as far back as 2017. The long story of Titanfall 1 issues and the arms race between the good and evil consists of many chapters, but most of the community was not aware of it up until late 2020, where Jeanue has eventually killed Titanfall 1 with its servers becoming a ghost town, and after a period of boredom decided to go after Titanfall 2.</p><p>If you want to download the original RedTape report we were basing off, you can search the MD5 hash on the Internet and in various messengers: <code>fc55dab68cf6182eb30eeb69a3da0d55</code></p><p>It will be a long read partly because of the sheer volume of the screenshots, many of them unrelated to the case in any way at all.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/OymVqlRuxk-984.avif 984w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/OymVqlRuxk-984.webp 984w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/OymVqlRuxk-984.jpeg" width="984" height="256"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>It is worth noting that when we refer to “Jeanue”, we in fact refer to the group of people that’s been behind the Titanfall attacks. It is hard to tell them apart, and the fact that they changed their names multiple times a day back in 2018 and 'till the present day made it impossible to always know who is who. However, the first speedhacker from their group that’s been known for the longest time went by the handle of “jeanue” before the name changing fest has started. Other members of the group ended up using the name for themselves as well on various occasions, given it was the only known name that people recognized in the long run, complicating the situation further.</p><p>We will elaborate on the attackers in the later sections, but for now remember that “Jeanue” can refer to any member of their group.</p><h1 id="messages-from-the-contributors">Messages from the contributors</h1><h2 id="l0s7">L0s7</h2><p>For those that know of me, it should be pretty clear that I’m not cool with Jeanue. I have gone to some great lengths to try to find a way to stop s/he/them. I believe each of us (contributors) do not approve of what ‘Jeanue’ has been doing, we have different methods, and have disagreed with each other about them. But we are still able to have civil discussions and recognize that we’re on the same team. Yes, Steyk develops cheats, which is interesting at a technical level but I don’t appreciate them being used in legit lobbies. Yes, Steyk admitted to me he was doing Apex at the time, which I also felt was probably a bad idea. But we do both agree that Jeanue has gone too far.</p><h3>Re: RedTape</h3><p>It seemed immediately obvious to me how far-fetched the accusations in UE/Redtape’s contents are, especially in the PDF file — screenshots cut crucial contextualization that makes or breaks the argument. I assume this is for the sake of brevity, yet they have tons of screenshots that don’t really serve any purpose. RedShield is a young man, why are you trying to make him look bad for hoping he can get a job at Respawn? Even in chat threads about this topic I’ve seen people that are outside of the situation recognizing this (MoDen says his BS detectors are going off). Frankly, their argument is poorly constructed. One of the limiting factors in creating private servers for Respawn games is that clients did not ship with a server.dll file, which contains essential code for running a server. For years people have brought up the idea of private servers without Jeanue; however, the answer was simply “we don’t have a server.dll, nothing we can do.” p0 et al initially believed it’d be too involved to create one that works for r1. Despite this huge technical hurdle (big maybe) for a low pop game, the group behind SaveTitanfall allege that:</p><ol><li>p0 concocted a multi-year plan to crash and kill r1, hoping that he’d…</li><li>eventually be able to (maybe?) create a working server.dll, so that…</li><li>while r1 is dead, spend hundreds/thousands of hours developing TFO to (maybe?) be able to make it a playable alternative to r1 with no plans for monetization, then…</li><li>provide TFO to the community for no gain, for the 50-100 people worldwide that’d be interested enough to jump through hoops to play it?</li></ol><p>Seriously.? It reeks of a conspiracy theory.</p><p>IMO, it is very clear. The people behind the RedTape doc and SaveTitanfall have absolutely no business being in charge of anything. They are <em>clearly</em> incapable of properly vetting information, and use their assumed positions to steer people in completely the wrong way. All are demonstrably, dangerously irresponsible by their actions. If I were to liken this to a much more extreme example, like say… They were generals sending troops in to battle: they sent everyone in to certain death based on <em>obviously </em>bad intel. But they were too inept to pick up on it. Is that the leader you want?</p><h3>Jeanue Background</h3><p>Jeanue has been learning about the Titanfall infrastructure since at least 2018. I know as I’ve been around since the very beginning, playing many games with Jeanue before he went illegitimate. I’ve watched his/her progression (and been a prime target). For those that don’t know, Jeanue was an extremely bad player at the beginning- and rather petulant. As after losing badly for a period of time he’d essentially stop playing and non-stop throw insults (racist included) at those beating him. Obviously, most of us just gave him shit right back and it blew his lid off.</p><p>He eventually started speed-hacking in 2016-2017, but the better players would literally team stack against him — he’d still lose. Due to this Jeanue would begin going farther and farther down the rabbit hole of trying to ‘win’. At first this person would, no joke, impersonate the people he hated while cheating (by mimicking their names) to try and turn the community against these people. He would use the name Salty-LOs7 for, like, 12 hours a day at the beginning. Because of the font TF1 uses in-game, some characters appear identical, such as 0 and O, i.e. there are screenshots of Jeanue using ‘pO358’ and asking for donations to p0’s actual PayPal donate link, but in-game his name appears as p0358 in most spots. Fortunately, it didn’t take very long for people to begin wising up to this obvious ruse. How come there’s a Salty-L0s7 and a Salty-LOs7 in the same room? (The first time I ever played with p0 in game, people were telling me he thought I was a hacker for some reason I didn’t know? Turns out p0 had seen Salty-LOs7 so much that he assumed I was Jeanue)</p><p>The first time I had heard of p0 (EU player, I’m a NA player so we didn’t cross paths) was through another player. We were in a lobby with Jeanue and my friend started telling me he’s going to message “p” to come boot Jeanue from the game. Apparently “p” knew some commands and could break the matchmaking temporarily for a specific player (Stryder would not put you in a lobby for 30-45min or something). “P” had used this on Jeanue a couple times to get him out in order that people could play normally. Once Jeanue saw that this was possible, I guess his interest was piqued about how. He would constantly ask p0 how to do it. I can specifically recall playing a match on Boneyard in 2018 that Jeanue was in and he was telling me that s/he had been studying the server API through p0’s TF stats page, and that ‘we’re fucked’ or something like that when s/he’s done. Remember that at this time, TF1 was perfectly playable (aside from Jeanue just annoying lobbies), no one talked about private servers, etc. Well not too long after that, Jeanue figured out the long name exploit, then scripted it to run 24/7. TF1 was unplayable for more than half of 2019.</p><p>p0 and RedShield started Remnant Fleet and organized TF1 events, since p0 had discovered a way to bypass Jeanue’s bots. I participated in some of these events, which Jeanue also tried to forcibly join multiple times and try to crash our games. All of this to basically say that I still consider p0 to not be the bad guy here.</p><h2 id="p0358">p0358</h2><p>I was always a fan of Titanfall, ever since seeing its first announcement at E3 in 2013. I even got a Titanfall-themed Xbox One console bundle back in 2014 to play it, months before it was officially available in my country. After completing the games on both Xbox consoles and getting a new PC, I got Titanfall 1 for PC as well, in early 2016, and it became my main platform.</p><p>I got interested in reverse engineering this game in 2017, after seeing the domain name of Stryder’s matchmaking backend in my DNS server logs and got interested in analyzing how is this game’s networking designed, knowing that Titanfall is based on Source engine, the engine of many games I played in childhood, yet heavily modified. You know, I always had that passion for checking how things work under the hood. But in computers, not cars.</p><p>As a result of my data-mining, I have found many cool and interesting things in the engine. I also began to understand how does the matchmaking system work and how the entirety of server design is functioning together. For example, I found out some hidden playlists, or how to modify your weapon skins without repacking the whole 60 GB of VPK files, or record demos to replay matches later. Yes, my findings also included various exploits and oversights, but those I have kept to myself, recognizing their potential danger if they ended up in wrong hands.</p><p>With all that knowledge, I wanted to created something cool, so I have created <a href="https://titanfall.top/status">my Titanfall status website</a>, inspired by tracker websites that many more popular games do have. It allows people to see the current player counters, along with details on which playlists are currently active, allowing you to check out, for example, if there are people in CTF, without launching the game. It also shows some player counts statistics and allows searching by player name, to see their playtime, skill and what they’re doing in-game, for example to justify if the game is worth joining.</p><p>Afterwards, in later 2017, I had my episode with Titanfall 2. I have added support for that game on my site, and while player counters display was fine, the player search was never working well, due to the large number of servers and players that overwhelms my server. The full server scan had to take at least 15 minutes and the data was often already outdated. Of other things, I created two overlays for Twitch streamers, one about <a href="https://youtu.be/B9XAAYJcAWI?t=68">generation display</a>, the other about <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/zimds/clip/SteamyResilientPepperoniTakeNRG">current kills counter</a>. I honestly tried to like this game too as much as I liked the original one, but I couldn’t, so I ended up coming back to Titanfall 1 and not touching Titanfall 2 again (apart from playing at the free weekend in 2021).</p><p>In 2016 and 2017 it was rather rare to encounter a cheater in Titanfall 1, at least on European servers. However, in 2018, a quite unique group of cheaters was formed: it was “jeanue”, the original one, from USA, and a Polish guy who would change his name every couple of days (Origin used to let you change your name once per 3 days, before they lifted that limit). Connected by their hatred towards the game and its community, they were unable to play and were always owned despite the use of cheats. Later on, the group would be joined by a third guy, supposedly from Philippines. All three proceeded to change their names daily, banter the players in lobbies with the nicknames and their behavior, including being extremely racist.</p><p>Their prevalence on the servers was causing a lot of disruption for the tiny Titanfall 1 community. It was not possible to not encounter them somewhere on the servers, and playing against three cheaters at once barely made sense. Numerous complaints and reports of their accounts in every possible channel were left unanswered. It was weird, because in 2016 there was a clan of five Titanfall 1 cheaters who would record their gameplay to YouTube, whom ended up getting their Origin accounts banned. As such, the community could not understand the lack of reaction roughly a year or two later.</p><p>With that, I decided to take matters into my own hands. The cheaters felt basically immortal. They were unafraid of anything. I thought that it is not fair that they got so comfortable annoying the playerbase with nothing to stop them. So, I decided to use my knowledge to mess with them and let them feel a taste of what they do to others themselves:</p><figure><div class="video"><a class="video__link" href="https://youtu.be/h-_U4mZ1GRI"><picture><source srcset="https://i.ytimg.com/vi_webp/h-_U4mZ1GRI/maxresdefault.webp" type="image/webp"><img class="video__media" src="https://i.ytimg.com/vi/h-_U4mZ1GRI/maxresdefault.jpg" alt="YouTube video"></picture></a><button class="video__button" aria-label="Play video"><svg width="68" height="48" viewBox="0 0 68 48"><path class="video__button-shape" d="M66.52,7.74c-0.78-2.93-2.49-5.41-5.42-6.19C55.79,.13,34,0,34,0S12.21,.13,6.9,1.55 C3.97,2.33,2.27,4.81,1.48,7.74C0.06,13.05,0,24,0,24s0.06,10.95,1.48,16.26c0.78,2.93,2.49,5.41,5.42,6.19 C12.21,47.87,34,48,34,48s21.79-0.13,27.1-1.55c2.93-0.78,4.64-3.26,5.42-6.19C67.94,34.95,68,24,68,24S67.94,13.05,66.52,7.74z"></path><path class="video__button-icon" d="M 45,24 27,14 27,34"></path></svg></button></div><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>While this approach was perhaps questionable in some ways, me and others felt it was justified.</p><p>Unfortunately, while some random cheaters got the memo and either abandoned cheating or the entire game, the Jeanue and his friends turned out to be special. They did not give up. And seeing how much the game is broken, they begun to research vulnerabilities on their own and use anything they have found against all the players. And they did find more than even I had known, their day-long attacks rendering the game completely unplayable in 2019. Initially they would do this manually, switching up, using the fact that they are in three different timezones, later (most likely) developing macros to automate their actions, before ending up with bots.</p><p>I didn’t feel like there was much that could be done at all at that time, except beg Respawn for help. We ended up getting <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/titanfall/titanfall-hackers">the first media article</a> after a few months of this tragedy, with other media outlets following. We felt that “now there’s no way Respawn wouldn’t notice and save us”. But we were wrong. Nothing happened.</p><p>Then later in 2019, a server named “Remnant Fleet” was formed by RedShield. He read up that the attackers are helpless if the server is full and thus they cannot join. So with that idea he decided to form a server to collect a group of 12 people willing to coordinate and join the servers at once, before the attacker could crash the lobby.</p><p>I learnt of that server soon after and joined. The idea was very refreshing, since none of my previous thought processes around what could be done next assumed having a coordinated group of people. Thanks to my knowledge we could gradually automate the game-forming process over time. Without me, the whole initiative would have probably died within a few weeks. In the course of months, from having two team captains get joined by teams and go to matchmaking (where any failure, including someone randomly disconnecting, would mean jeanue would join within a few seconds and screw up everything), we ended up with a fully automatic and reliable solution which required a single button press in a program, and once everyone was ready, it would connect everyone directly to a matchmaking server, a trick which was possible thanks to my knowledge of how Stryder works from two years before. Then we didn’t even need 12 players, because friendly bots would guard the missing spots, with the ability to replace them with incoming players on demand.</p><p>Under such scenario, RedShield has commented that at that point in time, we almost have forgotten about jeanue’s existence at all, and no games of us would get crashed, despite the general population being unable to play for long months — due to the game being under constant attack.</p><p>A major breakthrough was after MrSteyk developed his patch, after which the attacks stopped for a few weeks or months (though people from Jeanue’s team were still cheating in the game and reminding us of their existence constantly).</p><p>Unfortunately, it was a silence before the thunderstorm, because Jeanue ended up coming back with new waves of attacks, ones that were not patchable from client side, and ones for which workarounds were hardly possible. At that time I became busy with other things and didn’t try to work on Titanfall, or to play much.</p><p>In later 2020 we found out that he’s using some ways to lag the servers and make them appear as if they were completely dead and unconnectable despite responding normally to queries. We later learned that this is what we recognize now as “DoS”. I recognized the shape of this attack once we managed to go into actual match and encountered the characteristic symptoms. Interestingly, after the game got released on Steam, Jeanue stopped the attacks for around two weeks. After that period of time, he completely annihilated it again. There were some rare short periods of time where they’d go down and the game would work for a couple of hours. However, in their eventual attempts to fix the situation, Respawn only broke more things while not slowing the attacks down even a tiny bit, instead of fixing the root cause of the exploits.</p><p>This was when I realized all hopes for this game and for any improvements are completely lost, and while thinking of our options, I also remembered that TFO was a thing, and thus begun trying to launch that game, having more reverse engineering experience than years ago when I failed. Those fresh attempts did succeed, and as such, the slow progress there has begun, in order to reincarnate our favorite game under the form of that bizarre spinoff. <strong>Yes, you read this correctly. TFO project was born </strong><strong><em>as a direct result of Titanfall 1 being already dead</em></strong><strong> for long time, with no hope of that situation ever changing. It’s an innocent project. </strong>Not to mention all the positive changes that were made: new weapons, new maps, new UI, improvements in the engine, increased tickrate and wide modding possibilities. It could be an environment which we could secure against hacks ourselves, without relying on Respawn’s mercy. Sadly, the work on this was painfully slow from the beginning, with many things removed/missing and in need of being rebuilt.</p><p>Along the way, Titanfall 2 became a victim of Jeanue attacks with the same exploits that he used in Titanfall 1 since late 2020, starting with attacking streamers and ending up with attacking the whole community. “Creator Circuit” was formed as a response to that, where current information on attacks was gathered, and I, along with a few people from Remnant Fleet, were invited, and I strived to share the knowledge that I had and help out as much as I could. I even wrote an article describing in one place how to fix the game against all vulnerabilities that jeanue was using in the wild, having gotten a new hope of Respawn wanting to fix the game, after they pushed a server-side update for the first time in years.</p><p>Unfortunately, when I went on vacation in August to take a break from everything, I got stabbed in my back by a few people, when they apparently decided to release their funny document and accuse us of everything instead…</p><h2 id="mrsteyk">MrSteyk</h2><p>My journey with this game began with my pal explaining the situation that’s been going on with Titanfall 1 and asking if I can try to leverage that. I naturally agreed, got an invite to an intermediate Discord server and filled an application to RedShield. In the meanwhile, I’ve been reversing the network flow specifically. I knew you can’t simply make a client disconnect without forcing it to (timing the server out, using a command, shutting down netchannel and sending a disconnect packet, etc). That’s how the original fix surfaced. After that time (December 2019), I was barely seen in-game and played enough to be level 17-19 Gen 1.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/FVXSpqLt3C-1414.avif 1414w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/FVXSpqLt3C-1414.webp 1414w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/FVXSpqLt3C-1414.jpeg" width="1414" height="1178"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/B6ZP65_hzN-823.avif 823w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/B6ZP65_hzN-823.webp 823w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/B6ZP65_hzN-823.jpeg" width="823" height="179"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><h1 id="about-the-savetitanfall-com-noskill-team">About the SaveTitanfall.com / NoSkill Team</h1><p><strong>Initially claimed to have no knowledge of who the Apex attackers were, yet now they do and have known for a long time.</strong></p><h2 id="wanty">Wanty</h2><ul><li>Actively participated in many of the conversations cited by Operation RedTape, and has since (apparently) gone back and scrubbed many of his own messages.

A ton of information on US citizens is publicly available with savvy use of keywords and searches. Also, the prime suspect in the “Jeanue packet” provided to police could not have been considered to be actually harassed. When confronted it was a brief conversation that was allowed to end after the suspect denied knowledge of Titanfall. I will note here that reportedly, the virtual number used to call the suspect was signed up to bot spam lists after the call. Some of the spam bots addressed the recipient by their gamer tag in texts and calls. This person could not know the gamertag if they weren’t the hacker. Also, the relevant comments, uploads, and accounts that led to the suspect were deleted within two hours of the phone call. Let’s not get more into the mountain of evidence against this person here, but SaveTitanfall’s claim that the evidence is bunk is tissue paper thin at best.</p><p>The person that we could agree *was* harassed was JO (abbreviated for attempt at anonymizing). Through a series of misunderstandings, JO was presumed to be Jeanue. Cliff Notes: JO bought TF1 and was trying to log on to play, when he got a weird error message and he posted to a Facebook TF group asking how to play. Unfortunately for him, his name was similar to Jeanue, and he posted his question right as a couple people were testing a client patch for TF1. Some people ran with that. I’ve no doubt *many* people DM’d him, or called his work to trash talk him. When it was clear that JO was innocent, a point was made to inform the community that Jeanue was not JO, and at least one apology was sent to him on behalf of the community.</p><p>BY THE WAY, to you people over at SaveTitanfall/Creator Circuit who aggressively denounce doxxing, and also did so in the Operation RedTape report. <strong>You published JO’s, an innocent man’s, full name in your evidence without censorship.</strong></p><p><strong>p0358: </strong>While the circumstances aligned up really badly for JO, I never encouraged people to harass him or shared his details any further. I was not the person who found out that Facebook post, it was only shown to me. And even though everything really seemed like it’s that guy, I was always reminding people that there’s no direct and undeniable connection between him and the attackers, despite being myself convinced it was that guy back in a day. By the way, he was able to provide materials that cleared up his guilt — proof of game purchases with dates that lined up with the Origin account and its first/last play dates, along with the username. I was always bringing up the case of JO to NoSkill et al who collected all info on the attackers — to make this case a lesson we all should have learned — that facts seemingly lining up are never a proof of anything, and we really need to be cautious before drawing any conclusions. It seems they really have forgotten about this when making the RedTape report, publishing this guy’s full name was only a cherry on top from their side.</p><p><strong>JO himself:</strong></p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/TCarzRitJ3-1440.avif 1440w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/TCarzRitJ3-1440.webp 1440w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/TCarzRitJ3-1440.jpeg" width="1440" height="2789"></picture><figcaption>We as the community have fucked up back then.

If I wanted to be an attacker, I could take both games down completely even back in 2017. But I did not, because I’m not a dickhead and Titanfall is my favorite shooter after all, why would I?</p><p>We tried to report the exploits we encountered to Respawn/EA all that time, but to no avail. “Thanks, we’ll pass this on” was the only response we could ever get.

This was done to send people on witch hunts and therefore draw attention away from themselves © page 10</blockquote><p><strong>MrSteyk: </strong>This is straight up fact twisting. JO was innocent indeed and he was harassed by the community even though Red and p0 were against this, and JO was indeed found innocent and a community apology was made. Me and Doge were not in the community at the time.</p><p><strong>p0358:</strong> Apart from that mistake about JO, about which we never were sure in the first place, all the information we ever shared about Jeanue was true and based on actual findings. People from RedTape have never presented any clue whatsoever, based on which the materials were supposedly false. They just called them fake and silently moved on. Should I mention the irony of including the accusation of actions resulting in harassment and threatening of innocent people in the document which did exactly that?</p><blockquote>The following individuals are directly responsible for the July 4th Apex Legends hack as well as the blacklist that has been impacting streamers (and more recently, the entire playerbase) for months.</blockquote><p><strong>MrSteyk: </strong>I somehow missed this part the first time I read it. What will you say about doge getting blacklisted? Is he blacklisting his own account while he is playing for no real reason? He was forced to switch accounts.</p><p>Now let’s talk about blacklist actually: amongst blacklisted people there were individuals such as “taskinoz”, “Salty-L0s7”, “RTL-Manu” who were in the close circle related to TFO development and playtesting, why would we do this for prolonged periods of time? This AGAIN doesn’t really add up to the whole picture.</p><p>The only targeted “““attack””” that was condoned by me was on some twitch streamer, whose nickname I don’t even remember, it was literally months ago, lasted for like 10-15 minutes before he quit the game or I got bored, I don’t remember. Again, no one other than me is responsible for this “attack”, both Red and p0 didn’t know about this at the time.</p><p><strong>p0358:</strong> MrSteyk and dogecore were responsible for July 4th, but I have no idea how you drew the conclusion of responsibility for Titanfall blacklists from that, or how did you drag me into that, if I never even touched Apex’s code.</p><p>Also it’s worth to note that the single Titanfall 2 attack that Steyk has done was after he tried to reproduce Jeanue’s existing method that he used to mess with the server. And while one of the symptoms (disconnect message) was indeed the same, months later we realized that Jeanue was using an entirely different method himself. The only way people connected his one-time incident on those servers (which was admittedly very stupid) was the same disconnect message. Which is not enough of a proof to draw such a connection. It’s not a proof at all. It’s no surprise at all that the message was the same if he tried to reproduce the existing attacks at all though, is it?</p><p>And the reason we were all so curious about it, is because this was for the first time ever that Jeanue has used something new, and he has worked on his bots for months. And for the first time ever we had no clue what it is.</p><blockquote>Note: These individuals began planning months beforehand, primarily utilizing private channels in the Remnant Fleet discord server (owned by p0358 and RedShield) to discuss methods and delegate tasks. All of these channels have been backed up and they are unable to delete any evidence of these actions.</blockquote><p><strong>MrSteyk: </strong>Explaining how this is wrong on so many layers is a bit too difficult to put here. Wait until the detailed timeline section of the 4th July attack.</p><p>It’s true that we knew about the methods, but everyone with the glimpse of a brain and ability to reverse engineer would’ve found same stuff we did, we just didn’t want to put into the wild, because we would rather let the malicious party take time reverse engineering everything rather than using what’s been already publicly exposed. Also thank NoSkill for showcasing the methods “we” used and everyone mentioned knew, the game is gonna become so playable after that, boy I tell ya.</p><p><strong>p0358:</strong> You will need to see the later sections with comments on the screenshots to understand how ridiculous that statement is.</p><blockquote>p0; “He and his associates worked over the span of years to target Titanfall, Titanfall 2 and Apex Legends in the interest of his personal project TFO. ”</blockquote><p><strong>MrSteyk: </strong>Which years? I’ve joined the TF|1 community in 2019 with the sole purpose of fixing the game. I was dragged in by a pal of mine. In the end I found the exact issue Jeanue was using to make the game unplayable. Spoiler: it was long names.</p><p>p0 only specialises in Titanfall 1, he doesn’t own Titanfall 2 and Apex.</p><p>Titanfall 2 was not the game to target for “us” (the Russian group me and doge are in) because it’s so small and fragile even one fully connected client and one person made it half unplayable (context is from the only attack I ever did on TF|2). It also isn’t popular even now compared to Apex Legends. It’s true that “we” target the Apex, but as I said before — no personal goals, other than to fool around.</p><p><strong>p0358:</strong> Again, pure fairy tale, as you’ll see later. Titanfall 1's issues began in 2018. In 2019 it became pretty much completely unplayable. I could not find any solution to this, until TF Remnant Fleet discord server was formed up. Having a team of 12 players ready to challenge the attacks enabled so many new possibilities. We could coordinate together and use various tricks I’ve known thanks to reversing Titanfall’s code for 2 years and get on servers and play, bypassing the attacks and being secure against the crash bots. The whole story here is too long to tell.</p><p>I have mentioned Titanfall Online back in those days once. That there might be a possibility of reviving it. The possibility was always tempting, because having custom servers could mean we could really effectively fight attackers by fixing exploits at their root. Or even if not that, by just using IP whitelists/blacklists and physically stopping the bad apples from connecting. Unfortunately at that time my reverse engineering skills were still much worse and I failed even trying to launch that game big time. Using my existing knowledge on Titanfall 1 to let people play was much easier and actually worked, so the thought of reviving the exotic game was forgotten.</p><p>Later in late 2020/early 2021, when the game of Titanfall 1 has in fact became fully unplayable, with no trickery and bypasses possible (ironically Respawn changes to their matchmaking backend did not stop Jeanue, but I was no more able to connect to match servers directly to bypass the private lobby bots), I sit on the attempt to launch TFO again. Because it was the only chance to ever experience Titanfall 1 again, with no further client-side trickery possible to play this game anymore — only a server-side patch could help the situation, which Respawn has always refused to implement.</p><p>And that time, I actually succeeded with TFO, empowered with more reversing skills than before. And thus the silent project has begun. The fulfilment of the dreams of many. Custom servers, wide modding possibilities, better gameplay experience, possibility to secure the servers against any attackers lying in our hands. Remember, the project started as a direct result of Titanfall 1 being broken by the attackers and our will to again, do something about this fact ourselves, rather than just do nothing and cry.</p><p>Truly, the only people who could hate such a project were Jeanue et al. <a href="https://discord.com/channels/605775445757001768/606553413714575361/812026327602954280">Jeanue himself has come to our Discord server after finding out in order to insult us at that time</a>, as TFO meant the end of his control over the servers and he knew it. (link requires presence on TF Remnant Fleet to work; messages from Jeanue himself got deleted when he got banned by RedShield, due to excessive usage of n-word and thus breaking Discord ToS, but you can gauge the context from the messages of others)</p><blockquote>p0; “Multiple times, he gave information about “Jeanue” to people with the intention to instigate “witch hunts.”</blockquote><p><strong>MrSteyk: </strong>Story is mistold, he never gave personal information about a person called Jeanue.

For other information, I forwarded you to people who were the source of that information and who thus knew the best. The only info I could have ever mentioned was the first name of one of the guys there. And the countries of origin, again based on the IP addresses, and other information we collected, which was the only info I could really be sure of. This does not align at all with the tone of that statement, especially about witch hunts, where none of that was personally identifying information.</p><blockquote>p0; “This information found its way across Discord, Reddit, Youtube and Twitter, and ultimately all comes from this source.”</blockquote><p><strong>MrSteyk: </strong>p0 never shared any personal info, all he ever provided were IP addresses and info everyone could’ve scavenged from them.</p><p><strong>p0358:</strong> Exactly, none of the information shared was coming from me or given to these people by me.</p><blockquote>Dogecore […]</blockquote><p><strong>MrSteyk</strong>: Believe it or not — everything stated is correct.</p><blockquote>MrSteyk; “Develops and sells cheats for different video games, including Apex Legends”</blockquote><p>I don’t sell cheats, the only cheat I ever sold was for PUBGM that wasn’t even developed by me.

From our observations, they always wanted to destroy the games and aimed for actions that have the most impact. This is why in 2018, before discovering the game exploits, they were playing in parties of 3 in Titanfall 1, changing their names every couple of hours. Even though there were just three of them, their goal was to create an impression that the game is filled up with cheaters. And they did succeed with that sadly, the game’s population was decreasing rapidly at that time, because they sat in the game all day and it was hard to not come across them…</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/owrn8Dcj_U-594.avif 594w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/owrn8Dcj_U-594.webp 594w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/owrn8Dcj_U-594.jpeg" width="594" height="289"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/MKlEa-mCsM-940.avif 940w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/MKlEa-mCsM-940.webp 940w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/MKlEa-mCsM-940.jpeg" width="940" height="966"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/nQ5aQ7vO23-883.avif 883w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/nQ5aQ7vO23-883.webp 883w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/nQ5aQ7vO23-883.jpeg" width="883" height="772"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>MrSteyk: </strong>We (Remnant Fleet in this case) were trying to persuade RSPN to fix the Titanfall series: look at the dates — both games are unplayable, second one to a lesser degree compared to first.</p><p>Me and Doge didn’t want him to say anything about Apex because it’s a fine working game (was at the time and still is) and “we” want to leave exploits to ourselves.</p><p>The screenshot I sent and reddit posts refer to that one “attack” I did months ago at this point (was like a few days/weeks/a month ago tops at the time).</p><p><strong>p0358:</strong> And do you realize why we were so cautious about telling anything about the exploits publicly? It’s not really a mystery. Me and RedShield were always very cautious and paranoid about not revealing any more information to Jeanue than what he already knew, in order to not help him in his destruction goals in any way possible. And I knew sometimes even small clues could suggest him new methods, especially that he was usually pretty blind in what he was doing, and the bad logic of his bots could be used against him many times.</p><p>At that time, Jeanue himself was still annihilating Titanfall 1 24/7, but Titanfall 2 was fine. However he was working already on porting over his bots to Titanfall 2, which is made evident by random posts from February where servers were strangely lagging. It’s possible he was attacking streamers silently too during that period. At that point I myself wasn’t sure at all whether it’s him or if it’s just random server issues. The reason was that I could not believe Jeanue would ever come to Titanfall 2, if Titanfall 1 was the only game he ever targeted before.</p><p>MrSteyk tried to reproduce the issues from Titanfall 1 in Titanfall 2 to know whether they work there as well and whether Jeanue is to be feared of in Titanfall 2, and turned out so is the case.</p><p>You also see the wording very clearly saying it’s not us being Jeanues + that what MrSteyk done was just a test conducted on a single day. The whole question on whether anything related to Titanfall 2 or Apex should be said was because the article was meant to be about Titanfall 1. Thus the concern on whether they should be mentioned as something that could potentially be vulnerable too. The question of comfortability with sharing those arises from the fear that it could suggest Jeanue to look into crashing those games.</p><p>“Thankfully” NoSkill never had such dilemmas and just dumped all the conversations with descriptions of the exploits publicly, Jeanue must be thankful to them for their help.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/gBClX2z5I6-945.avif 945w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/gBClX2z5I6-945.webp 945w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/gBClX2z5I6-945.jpeg" width="945" height="1214"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>MrSteyk: </strong>The GLL thing is a fun meme (for our Russian group, unrelated to Titanfall or RF) if you were around at the time.</p><p>Yes, I did that one attack a month ago at that point in time. Fucking thanks Wanty, this will surely make the game playable, just you wait until you can’t even log into the lobby because of this screenshot publicly showcasing info about how I did it for everyone to see.</p><p><strong>p0358:</strong> I was surprised to see “overflow error” in Titanfall 2, because jeanue has usually used the method that shows “ReadPacketEntities: failed”. “Overflow error” was what he used more frequently in Titanfall 1, along with the exploit that he used in Titanfall 2. This is where my “but we weren’t fully sure what jeanue did in r2 I think” comes from, because “overflow error” was just one thing, and even that, as it turned out, was reproduced by MrSteyk using a completely different method.</p><p>“The command I was using back in a day” refers to me messing with Jeanue in order to prevent him from playing and messing with the players in Titanfall 1 and destroying that game back in 2018. I gave up on doing that when he found an exploit in EA Origin itself (!) that allowed him to play regardless.</p><p>It turned out that the post I linked was, however, result of what MrSteyk did on a singular day of March 12th and not Jeanue, who targeted streamers exclusively at that point, if anyone, in-game.</p><p>It’s worth to pinpoint that Jeanue was only ever attacking servers of ongoing matches, while MrSteyk wanted to test how easy it is to cause disturbance on Titanfall 2 lobbies with their modified design compared to Titanfall 1, and a few moments on an English-speaking datacenter was enough to make reddit posts about the issues appear. While it was an interesting insight, I don’t think he should had been testing things like this publicly, even though there was no other way to find that point out. Nonetheless, while certainly wrong, it’s still a tear in the ocean compared to what Jeanue does. I don’t think what MrSteyk did really mattered in the long run. But yes, he did mess with some servers on that single day and undeniably got exposed for that here.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/ztK1noWUI6-932.avif 932w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/ztK1noWUI6-932.webp 932w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/ztK1noWUI6-932.jpeg" width="932" height="1204"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>MrSteyk: </strong>Previous comments still relate to this image.</p><p>And yes, doge and I liked doing what we did, they fixed the issue I was talking about in this screenshot a long time ago, even before the 4th of July happened, they fixed it right before the official EA tournament.</p><p><strong>p0358:</strong> Okay, so first thing is, we mock Respawn for removing existing Source engine’s protections against DoS. “One simple trick” to make sure they don’t accidentally hit rate limits, <em>by removing them altogether</em>, is a sarcastic part of that mock.</p><p>Me saying it’s unfortunate if they fixed it in Apex was a direct result of how Respawn acknowledged Titanfall issues, finally, after 3 years, and the reactions under that post and my anger about it. Thing is, all their tweets were about Apex, for the past 2 years. They ONCE mentioned Titanfall and Apex community went apeshit. The saltiest in the replies were the so-called “pros”, big influencers who should set out to give a good example to the community, and not bitch like a bunch of kids that the developer wants to dedicate <em>some</em> resources to fix the game that suffered from issues for so long. With their attitude against another game’s attacks getting fixed, I concluded that they themselves deserved the attacks that they got. And this is something that most of Titanfall community agreed with, they were pissed about Apex players reactions.</p><p>It was also an acknowledgement of why they don’t want to talk about some exploits, because the reason was just simply logical, agreeing with it or no.</p><p>Then there’s a mention of TFO. Where I worry that jeanue might try to attack this project with the same exploits. Notice how we always refer to him in the third person and how we want to combat him. This is something that will appear many times in the screenshots supposed to be “incriminating” against us…</p><p>Also, the motive of “Titanfall 1 being dead turning out better for TFO” — it’s just an analytical observation based on the fact that Titanfall 1 and Online are just so similar, and thus would share the same playerbase for the most part. Thus ironically if both games were to be alive, it would hurt the population of both at the same time. Of course Respawn should fix their games and not sell broken stuff on the stores, it was never ever denied by me or anyone else. But the ironically positive attitude of finding good things in a bad situation led me to draw the conclusion that Titanfall 1 being dead might actually be better for us in ways. Which again does not imply that I’d WANT it to be that way. Just accepting the reality that I cannot change. It was also a part of the general attitude of being mean to Jeanue — “okay, you killed Titanfall 1 and won on that, but we still have that thing up our sleeves, and you can’t do anything about it”. We’ll come back to this point later.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/VXf0hu3dhy-942.avif 942w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/VXf0hu3dhy-942.webp 942w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/VXf0hu3dhy-942.jpeg" width="942" height="280"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>MrSteyk: </strong>About the fixes — we were working on TFO which is based on really old TF|1, so it’s only natural that it has a lot of the vulnerabilities that have been patched now.</p><p>I was taking entrance exams at the time, so it’s only natural I brought up the army then me and octo switched to Russian for our useless (in this case) convo.</p><p>I know that whole NoSkill team is American, but holy shit do you fear Russian language that much?

Yes I know who did that, ffs, and? Yes I also “enjoy” (I don’t) being blamed the instant something happens, only because they knew about me from “that group”. Keep in mind they didn’t know about dogecore until much later when I invited him to help TFO development, everyone agreed it’s a nice choice. But like the only person (mentioned in the RedTape PDF) who knew about dogecore before that was p0, but it wasn’t much and his opinion of him was really sketch at the time because the only thing he knew him for was screwing with Apex.</p><p>Also as you can see on the apex screenshot — there was a code leak, I wanted to play in the private match in Apex for the first time, albeit from a shitty hardware, cuz another machine was running Linux at the time, if I recall correctly.</p><p><strong>p0358:</strong> Not much to add here. Notice my mention of jeanue. It’s possible that with him using all methods to screw with us, he’d pull out his bots in Titanfall 1 just to mess with us and decrease the potential playerbase. Like look, we started TFO because he killed TF1, so he’d take the primary reason we put so much time into reviving that game by then bringing TF1 back to life when it’s ready.</p><p>That’s also in line with how he was stopping all the attacks for some time when any of the Titanfalls was getting any media spotlight and Respawn looking into it, probably to make them think their workarounds did the job and “their job here is done”.

Titanfall 2 was being attacked in every game that had more than one player by, supposedly, Jeanue (it’s not hard to look like him, I’ll be honest, that’s why we are never sure who the hell is the culprit exactly, they all blend like 2ch (Russian 4chan kind-of) users).</p><p>Email is technically correct and outlined every aspect in as much detail as we could without making it seem like a joke (go in details too much and people will think you see them as dumb fucks). Guessing Ryan K Rigney’s email wasn’t hard, literally almost every enterprise uses the same email format…</p><p>Yet again we thank Wanty for sharing something that Jeanue, supposedly, didn’t know.</p><p>And yes I wanted to keep the communication channel active and actively aid as much as I could without breaking enterprise boundaries (Respawn simply would’ve not allowed this to happen, but come to think of how FIFA was dumped…).</p><p>And yes that damn Protocol 3 Weapon Charm was literally the biggest mock at the time. TF|1 was unplayable, TF|2 had almost every match DoS’d at the time, and instead of doing anything about it, they release that thing for Apex. For some reason people disregard the dates and think this all happened as one continuous flow.</p><p><strong>p0358:</strong> These screenshots literally show our care for Titanfall and fear that if they fix things, they might not manage to fix everything and then Jeanue would still mess with the game they’d think got fixed, because the list of exploits stacked up. And at that point I didn’t believe they’d ever fix it, based on my 3 years of experience of watching them do nothing. It has changed later in July when they pushed a first ever server-side update to Titanfall 1 in 6 years (!). Then I wrote my article detailing all the things I know, so that they can fix them if they’re into fixing the game. I was hopeful, but they ignored everything. Yes, <strong>nothing </strong>from my article got implemented.</p><p>Not to mention you have a proof that MrSteyk has again sent some of the exploits to Respawn to have them fix that, not that they were not aware of this already.

But when that period ended, they went back to convincing people the game is perfectly playable and works fine and to trust them on that. However, EA support is irrelevant here for this topic, so enough about it.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/iq5m9aKTQO-770.avif 770w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/iq5m9aKTQO-770.webp 770w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/iq5m9aKTQO-770.jpeg" width="770" height="646"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/ZsaTKuq5_u-499.avif 499w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/ZsaTKuq5_u-499.webp 499w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/ZsaTKuq5_u-499.jpeg" width="499" height="601"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/9fej0tuXLg-718.avif 718w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/9fej0tuXLg-718.webp 718w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/9fej0tuXLg-718.jpeg" width="718" height="618"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>MrSteyk:</strong> Ok, guy wants a job at Respawn, what’s next?

Practically, before any loud media articles were made at all, we tried to send them the exploits Jeanue team used at that time privately, hoping that the situation can be resolved in a simple way if we let them know how, and these fixes were resent to many people many times later.

Thus, I forgot about TFO until very late 2020.

Again analogy with knowledge of using a gun and accusation of killing.</p><p><strong>p0358:</strong> I think “one of these people” referred to “people knowing some bugs”. Because yeah, I did know the bugs. And if I was a bad party like Jeanue, I could abuse them much earlier and on a much bigger scale, that is just a fact. But I did not. Because why the heck would I want to kill my favorite game that I tried to save from hackers for so long?

Depends, but I don’t think it was more destructive than what “we” did, streamers were literally forced to quit the game. Again, “we” are not connected with Remnant Fleet, only me and doge ever communicated with the administration. p0 dropped ONE streamer back to lobby AT THE START OF THE MATCH ONCE in 2017, just to see if the bug affected everyone, he found it funny at the time (2017), hence “troll”. We, again, thank NoSkill for leaking methods used.</p><p><strong>p0358:</strong> Yes, some streamers in this case was a single streamer, once, in 2017, with an exploit that Jeanue didn’t know before NoSkill posted their pdf. So that was a pointless overexaggeration on my part. I even remember the name of that streamer, it was KILLER1POINT. If you’re reading this and you’re mad that you got thrown back into lobby at the start of the match once back in 2017, I’m sorry.</p><p>The whole point of that, however, was to test if this thing only affects me, or everyone else too. And since I had nobody to help me test that, I went on Twitch, since that shows the screen of another person and it let me test that out quickly and easily. Afterwards I realized how potentially dangerous this thing could be in bad hands and I shut up about that thing and made sure nobody finds out about it.

I personally don’t believe he would deserve all the hate for this thus, even though ironically MrSteyk and dogecore got almost zero hate out of the whole drama, compared to me, who haven’t even done things like this. Where is the logic? (Not that I suggest anyone should hate on them, witch hunting is bad, and especially pointless if you do it to innocent people rather than the actual attackers)</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/raRJ18uDPM-474.avif 474w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/raRJ18uDPM-474.webp 474w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/raRJ18uDPM-474.jpeg" width="474" height="516"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>MrSteyk: </strong>What do you want for this picture?

They tried at that time to trick the logic of Jeanue bots and find ways to play Titanfall 2 and not get annihilated by bots at that time, despite being on the blacklist. And they did. One of the ways they found was to play in a private match alone, then the bots would leave the player alone (he already patched that).

Yes, “we” are responsible for almost every publicly known Apex attack. The first and other screenshots were made by different people for some reason. After that there’s a normal civil discussion about Respawn’s decisions at the time. We mentioned opening source code/giving us access to it only because the game was unplayable for so long. LOOK AT THE DATES FFS. But most of the time it’s Linksys being in his world — he doesn’t have the best English and technical knowledge, might even be the case here, those conversations happened long ago.</p><p>I know that Americans fear Russian language, so I will put original and translated messages from the last screenshot:</p><ul><li>*mention of me* меняй статус — change status (discord’s feature)</li><li>снова — again</li><li>сделано — done</li><li>откуда тут эта гифка — from where this gif is (more contextual translation: How did he get this GIF)</li><li>я сюда отправлял — I have sent it here before</li></ul><p>If you don’t trust me, use OCR or copy this text and put it into google translate to get a glimpse of it being harmless.</p><p><strong>p0358:</strong> Okay, as MrSteyk said about Linksys here. The guy does not speak English at all, he is using Google Translate and there are thus problems communicating with him. His place in this chat was mostly to translate the game into his language, because he wanted to do that. Picking up on anything he says is thus a real dick move.</p><p>And in spite of his lack of decisive power whatsoever in these cases, the thing he probably meant was counting on Respawn releasing the server files for Titanfall 1, to host community servers there, it’s a desire many people have expressed since the very release of the game. He’s not really technical, so I don’t know if he doesn’t understand the difference between source and binaries, or whether this was something that got poorly translated.</p><p>Nonetheless, nobody from our team has ever wanted to obtain any source code, nor was source code ever needed for anything we ever wanted to accomplish with TFO. You will not find any of the core team members ever mentioning such “desire” anywhere, because that part of the conspiracy is the most ridiculous fairy tale that they made up.</p><p>And even if Linksys himself really wanted any source code for whatever reason, he’s not part of the core team, he’s just a player/translator with access to the channel, which was given to him, because he wanted to help out and was also a very long-time and dedicated Titanfall 1 player. Even if he wanted anything like that, that does not project that on anyone else, just like any random person in the world could say such words.</p><p>I consider the story of “source code” fully explained and its case closed here.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/Q_QcfrgA0s-854.avif 854w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/Q_QcfrgA0s-854.webp 854w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/Q_QcfrgA0s-854.jpeg" width="854" height="718"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>MrSteyk: </strong>They fixed the issue in question, If I wasn’t talking about fucking EVO shields — I hate them with my heart and soul after having to deal so much with finding normal gear and getting to last squad with like blue body armour and gray helmet.</p><p>More flexibility is that TFO has almost everything in scripts and it’s always easier to edit those, hence “cause this gives us only more flexibility” compared to something that’s purely native (compiled binaries).</p><p><strong>p0358:</strong> And me, I was talking about my very stupid idea of how to detect someone picked up a weapon from the ground, due to lack of better ideas. This is why MrSteyk asked “are you high?”. Then I mentioned how some of the things in their scripts are implemented in very interesting ways, and how some of the comments mention that. Also lot of stuff was implemented in scripts that they believed should be moved to native code, but the fact that they were left in scripts, gives us more flexibility for modding and changing things, as MrSteyk mentioned above. Completely unrelated to the main point of their document, another random screenshot just to distract people.</p><p>Also contrary to what RedTape claims, it’s pretty clear that here “sins” refer to them breaking up the engine even more in stupid ways while trying to fix/improve it. They claimed the otherwise was said in their doc, so they conveniently didn’t show this screenshot in whole, because it would be evident that what they claimed is total bullshit.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/vek9eX6C2W-747.avif 747w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/vek9eX6C2W-747.webp 747w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/vek9eX6C2W-747.jpeg" width="747" height="834"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>MrSteyk: </strong>Civil discussion.</p><p>“Improvement” I talked about is really questionable and allows for a little exploit only possible in Apex and not in any other games because of the weapon mechanic.</p><p><strong>p0358:</strong> With my message I jokingly refer to the naive belief out there that Easy Anti-Cheat can magically secure the game against everything on its own, which is contrary to its own docs:</p><blockquote>Game logic errors, bugs, or edge cases are often discovered and exploited by players.

The listed things aren’t the worst someone could do with such kind of exploit, so we can hope none of the Respawn games would ever get something like this existing and found.</p><p>Besides that, MrSteyk refers to some exploit that Respawn has accidentally created while trying to fix something, a scenario that seems to be repeating frequently. I think I got to know what it was in the end. And said that he could look into TFO to check whether it has that to know whether there’s something we could fear of being exploited and potentially fix. Remember he’s on our side?</p><p>inb4 someone accuses us of any selfishness here, we can only patch any exploits in TFO, because only there we have a server-side access and the physical power of fixing anything, while Respawn doesn’t fix even the most destructive exploits for years.

This is speculated to be the reason that NoSkill went apeshit against Remnant Fleet, especially Red and p0, since Red is the server creator, p0 is a well known and respected figure who helped TF|1 more than anyone did, it also looks like he himself parted ways with SaveTitanfall (not to mention SaveTitanfall is irrelevant now, game is playable, their website still (at the time of writing) talks about Titanfall 1).</p><p>And we also change date formats again, this makes my head go apeshit and this also looks like some admin chat, I got zero access to those, got no proof since I was later banned. But remember to look at dates and keep a rough timeline if you are a sensible person. The 7th month being July, after the 4th of July incident Wanty perfectly knew about, also explains why they (NoSkill admins) removed the link at approx 11th of July (look through web archive if you want to confirm that). They didn’t remove it when shit hit the fan to redirect all the traffic of mad Apex players to the Remnant Fleet.</p><p>Secret project is Titanfall Online Revive — our project on trying to resurrect that abandoned and cancelled game, without making any profit (we would use our own money or ask people to host servers) — Wanty also perfectly knew about this part.</p><p><strong>p0358:</strong> This is from our moderation chat. In addition to everything that MrSteyk said above, the whole disconnection between Remnant Fleet and SaveTitanfall.com was pretty weird, it happened after a talk that RedShield had with Wanty that I wasn’t a part of, and I wasn’t informed of the reasons thoroughly. I mostly based what I was saying on our previous talk (where RedShield was mostly absent on the other hand). I heard they claimed they recorded this conversation. Rest assured they will <strong>never</strong> publish that recording in whole if it exists, because it contains VERY incriminating things against them.</p><p>Basically, the whole disagreement was on our goals. We just wanted to play our game. If TFO was ready, we weren’t really that interested in keeping asking Respawn about fixing Titanfall, if we have our way to play our game (that is better btw, due to things I outlined already).</p><p>Them on the other hand, they wanted to hold Respawn accountable. They wanted to portray them in the bad picture at every cost. They wanted to go as for as to fake the DoS or replicate it ourselves (!) if Jeanue was to stop his attacks, just to put Respawn in as bad light as it’s possible. It was not an idea that I was really convinced of at all. I only informed them it’s possible to fake the DoS effect client-side without attacking the actual server, a finding which wasn’t even mine by the way.</p><p>Additionally, the things they wanted from us were really suspicious, they basically wanted to censor every word we say, they wanted everything to go through them, they wanted a total monopoly over any talk related to saving Titanfall. They used arguments that made sense, but the end goal that they were approaching was a censorship of me and RedShield. RedShield in particular didn’t like what direction it was going to and ended up distancing himself and the server from them. For me it wasn’t a huge red flag back then yet, because I believed that their intentions were genuine. They were not.

FFS, they had 4 people working on this shit. Even the cheater group evidence doc “the group I’m in” did had more believable evidence and more concise evidence of the wrongdoings.</p><p>p0 talks about worst case scenario that people can grasp if they are braindead (TF|1 is unplayable but TFO:R is playable somehow, doesn’t this seem a bit sketch? No it doesn’t — first one is done by the company who refused to fix the game for years, second one was done by fans who know their shit). TF|1 was unplayable in February of this year.</p><p>Also can’t you just see that Red uses spoilers? p0 even uses “xd” and no one in their right mind uses that when they are serious.</p><p><strong>p0358:</strong> Hold up. Full stop. <strong>We need to get a few things straight here.</strong> Firstly, it’s a jump to a different channel than before (not a channel of TFO project, mind you!), right in the middle of the discussion. Secondly, the topic of that thing, was what RedShield started, and his idea was to take down Titanfall 2 for 48 hours officially in order to bring awareness for Titanfall <strong>1</strong> issues and have Respawn fix it. <strong>1</strong>!!! Titanfall Online was completely <strong>irrelevant</strong> in this discussion.</p><p>This was not a serious plan, but a mere idea/theoretical scenario. And everyone was basically roasting it, including me on that screenshot. It seems that RedShield has not understood that it’s a roast, so I later replied: and I did say that it’s a dumb idea.</p><p>My first message was a response to MOM, who said that doing something like this while we’re working on Titanfall Online, a <strong>completely irrelevant</strong> project to what was discussed there, would be a terrible idea. Because if people who would theoretically hold Titanfall 2 ransom for some time to raise awareness, and probably get hated for it, if they turned out to be ones working on some Titanfall project themselves, this would be detrimental to its image.</p><p><strong>AND HE WAS FULLY RIGHT — Operation RedTape exactly lied about such association and it did unsurprisingly make the community hate us when they believed those lies.</strong></p><p>Which is the exact reason we did NOT want to do anything like that and would NOT and have NOT done anything like that.</p><p>I don’t even understand why RedShield brought this whole idea to the table in the first place honestly. We did not need to save Titanfall 1 anymore. Having Titanfall Online, we could play this game on our own terms, not endangered by any hackers or anything like that, or with possibility to fight them, with modding, better servers, etc. Even if Respawn fixed Titanfall 1, they would probably not fix everything properly, because they had a track record of doing poor fixes before. Which means Jeanue would be back and the whole cycle of begging Respawn for a fix for weeks if not longer would repeat. This isn’t a very tempting situation. Which is why this idea was stupid from top to bottom and everyone was calling it off.</p><p>I don’t really like how RedShield handled this situation in the end, removing me as a Remnant Fleet admin and removing my access from the channels, making it hard for me to look up the context and defend myself. Selfishly clearing his own name at the cost of others, especially when he was the one who started off this dumb conversation in the first place (which seems to be the most “incriminating” screenshots they have on us, especially if all cut out of the whole thing), does not seem fair. I’m deeply disappointed in that. However, if one of RedTape’s goals was to destroy Remnant Fleet, and everything suggests it was, they did thus succeed in that. Congratulations, two years of my work is destroyed thanks to these lies. I hope your four is happy now.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/DO_imCoqfz-974.avif 974w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/DO_imCoqfz-974.webp 974w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/DO_imCoqfz-974.jpeg" width="974" height="282"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>MrSteyk: </strong>I don’t remember the context for this clearly.

Or nothing that would satisfy us at all — they could quickly fix Titanfall 2 like they’d fix Apex, and Titanfall 1 would remain broken as it was.</p><p>With that I ultimately conclude that sticking to r1o — that is to developing the Titanfall Online mod project — would be the most reasonable. Focusing on the positive effort.</p><p>After that the whole thread completely died up and we ended up talking about how TFO should be shaped up after I mentioned it and what approaches should we take in relation to various things.</p><p>As Steyk said, I mentioned propaganda bots too. It was one of the ideas, but it was never chased, due to being “too edgy” and just weird in the first place, requiring unproportionally huge amount of work that’s better spent elsewhere, and even the servers didn’t work in the first place for months after this discussion, so it didn’t make any sense in the first place.</p><p>To sum up for people following us up until here. There was a discussion brought up of a theoretical scenario of killing Titanfall 2 temporarily to raise attention for Titanfall 1 and get it fixed. It was unrelated to Titanfall Online and on its own very stupid. After seeing all the disadvantages, we completely called this idea off. It’s worth to note that it was all long before Jeanue touched Titanfall 2 and at that point we never believed he’d leave Titanfall 1, at which point was completely annihilated for three months.</p><p>With this, their “evidence” on supposed Titanfall 2 attacks ends. “More of a meme than legit strategy” called off as being one of the most stupid things that could possibly be done, completely dropped and never mentioned again. Seriously? Based on this you accuse us of Titanfall 2 attacks?</p><p>Not to mention the accusation says it’s supposedly me and others attacking Titanfall 1 (bruh, I think the readers should already see how ridiculous that claim is when all of us fought for 3 years to defeat the attackers) and Apex Legends (which was only done by MrSteyk and dogecore, about which nobody seemed to care, given they got no angry messages about this whatsoever).</p><p>They could not find a single screenshot whatsoever that could even suggest we would attack Titanfall 1, or that me, p0358, would ever even touch Apex.

Instead of saying this game isn’t for them, or learning to improve, they sat in the game and complained that everyone else was hacking, and/or insulted everyone for ruining their games. Clearly, this individual was not destined to be popular in the community.</p><p>2017- Hacker begins using cheats/hacks with names like “paybackishell7” and “snwodtaeb” (beatdowns backwards), or mimicking other player names to masquerade (turns out [redacted] has an identity theft charge, coincidence?) as them. Simple things like an O instead of zero, or 1 instead of I. But the font makes them harder to distinguish. Hacker is online for huge swaths of the day. For HOURS a day non stop. Obviously whoever is doing this is not quite right in the head. Later on they were able to copy other player names directly.</p><p>2018- Hacker still can’t win games against players that organize against him <strong>so this is where he begins crossing into illegal territory</strong>. He starts experimenting with how to break the underlying software.</p><ul><li>First he figures out how to bypass any naming restrictions built in to the software (length, offensive word rules, etc) so he starts using names like “NIGGER EXTERMINATOR,” “KILL ALL THE NASTY NIGGERS,” ([redacted] has a history of racism online, apparently), would spam chat with racist jokes and play racist songs over in game voice chat.</li><li>Second he learns how to forcibly “join” (ie play with a friend) anyone regardless of if someone is even friends with him on that platform. Even if the other person has blocked him, he can bypass the block. Soon he realizes that he can use this to exploit the group leader’s ability to leave the game as a group, he can join anyone else and then leave as a group as if he was the party leader — removing them from games. This is akin to him walking into someone else’s business, and throwing normal customers out on his own whims. <em>Other times Hacker will join someone he despises in particular, and play in the game room, and just harass and anger everyone, while refusing to leave.</em></li><li>Hacker learns how to use an exploit to cause other clients/customers’ game client to crash and give an error of “Too many proxies for datatable DT_playerbase” which is something we don’t believe he has automated. He had to manually attack every individual that was playing. “Whenever you got crashed with ‘Too many proxies’, just know it wasn’t a bot, this idiot was sitting at his desk 16 hours a day to try to actively kill a game. It sounds stupid, and it is. But it’s true.”</li><li>“In the waning hours of 2018, Hacker hooked up a second account with some special Source exploits. He calls it Atomic Bomb. He would make a whole show of it, he’d join a match using a server browser, trash talk players on his main account, throw slurs relentlessly, mock, insult, and bully other players. Then when ready, or when he didn’t feel like mocking players, he would connect Atomic Bomb to the lobby. This 'player' would announce that it would execute a script, causing the whole lobby to crash.”</li></ul><p>2019-</p><ul><li>Hacker has been attempting to use ‘scripts’ to automate his attacks, he wants the game to be completely unplayable for everyone. Many methods prove difficult.</li><li>Hacker fully scripts ATOMIC BOMB to connect to the game servers 24/7/365, effectively making it impossible to play for anyone, anywhere. Once you’ve launched the game, get to the main menu, the instant you clicked “Play Titanfall” you’d get kicked back by an error message of random characters.</li><li>ATOMIC BOMB is running for most of the year</li></ul><p>2020-</p><ul><li>A few software inclined members of the community had been working to counteract Hacker’s attacks. A block was devised for ATOMIC BOMB. Titanfall was playable for the majority of the year.</li><li>Hacker reverts back to being a standard in-game player who cheats and harrassing others.</li><li>Hacker can still manually crash people, but that is time intensive and he must dedicate himself to it, so it is more sparing. He occasionally comments to others that he is working on a new bomb.</li><li>Nearing the end of the year Hacker’s bots are starting to attack again</li><li>In December some players attempted playing with “BME” installed, a community developed update that patches certain exploits Hacker takes advantage of, making it harder for Hacker to crash them.</li><li>In retaliation Hacker turns up his manual crashing activities</li></ul><p>2021-</p><ul><li>Hacker’s new bomb is live. The short version is that this version exploits not the game client’s behavior, but the server’s behavior. The game is presently completely inaccessible and will just say “No Servers Found” if you try to play. The only way to fix it is by a server side update, which the public has zero control over. Titanfall has been in this state for the entirety of the year, with a couple lapses in bot activity that were only a couple hours in duration, each time.</li><li>In March/April Hacker accounts are crashing streamers and joining their chat, using phrases like “Hacker power,” “Hacker is a god”</li></ul><p>During this time, Hacker’s ego explodes. Frequent phrases in-game: “Hacker is a god,” “I run shit here,” ‘I am the god of titanfall,’ ‘you can play only when I want to.’ <strong>On a couple occasions, Hacker would solicit players to send money to stop.</strong> Our psych profile of this guy is that he’s egomaniacal, racist, petty, and this whole ordeal is centered around him ‘winning.’ He/she cannot handle losing and the tit-for-tat has made them dedicate years of their lives to trying to ‘win’ against some people in a video game. This has morphed from winning game rounds, to denying anyone from playing at all. Guess the saying is true for him, the only way to win is not to play the game.</p><h2 id="now-how-do-we-know-we-found-the-right-people">Now, how do we know we found the right people?</h2><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/J4eMc60nVL-945.avif 945w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/J4eMc60nVL-945.webp 945w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/J4eMc60nVL-945.jpeg" width="945" height="2048"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/JL1eEfXWkB-945.avif 945w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/JL1eEfXWkB-945.webp 945w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/JL1eEfXWkB-945.jpeg" width="945" height="2048"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Looks like Hacker was commenting on YT videos about him, and that account has car videos uploaded?

I (L0s7) have played with him just fine (suspiciously aimbotty behavior), but once I talked trash to him on an alt (without ever seeing 'the jeanue' at any point) the next time I tried to play with that alt account it was 'blacklisted' in TF1. Before that egatreze has been partied with Jeanue in game on occasion.</p><p>He has slipped up and connected without a VPN before. We don’t have a lot of information about him, but his IP address is registered in Warsaw, Poland (not where p0 lives) and runs a custom router firmware. He always denied hacking in the in-game chat but as soon as I chatted his IP, all of a sudden he said that getting player IP addresses is easy and that p0 is in (city name).</p><p>He also very clearly spoke native Polish on multiple occassions. Please refer to the incident on which he joined Remnant Fleet mentioned in the “evidence” section and how he messaged Leprawel, RF moderator.</p><p><strong>Philippino dude:</strong> We also don’t have any personal information about this person. But they have connected in game with Jeanue (total of 3 people) and his IP had no VPN detected, originating from Manila. Jeanue claimed in game that he was his “paid nigger slave,” lending credence to the idea that Jeanue paid people to help him get the ball rolling. Automated crash bots of Titanfall 1 have also been running from this person’s IP address in the past.</p><p></p><p>In DM’s the RedTape authors have basically said it’s possible the suspect alluded to earlier was Jeanue 'at one point', but also say they’re sure Jeanue NOW is not them… Why? They won’t say, they (RedTape authors) just think the “suspects” are not Jeanue, at least any more… Are they guarding a secret?</p><p></p><p>We’ve now seen more and more of Wanderer’s behavior, crashing Titanfall lobbies, impersonating p0358 (classic J move)… A history of crashing CSGO lobbies, and when asked on twitch why they don’t mess with some other, bigger game if they’re only around to piss people off… A Jeanue account responds that maybe they’d move to CSGO?

As the situation with the attacks developed, he decided to make a short and concise post summarizing the situation across both games in bullet points — making informative posts like that is a normal part of a subreddit moderation. But in order to pin that post, he had to unpin the previously pinned one, which happened to be coolcryptid’s wall of text containing links to the savetitanfall.com website (with which the sub wasn’t afilliated) and to a survey related to attacks.</p><p>It was a slap in the face to coolcryptid. Thus he contacted the subreddit moderation to get explanations on the removal and was redirected to hiticonic on Discord — something that is an exception from the general rule that all moderation actions should be disputed by anonymous mod mail in order to prevent the exact situation that happened here — attacking the individual moderators for their decisions — an exception that was made by abusing the trust that the community shared towards savetitanfall.com.</p><p>Not cooperating with them made hiticon one of the targets to get destroyed in the drama they were preparing — getting him highlighted out of many people who had access to the hidden channels, despite his activity there being rather small.</p><p>For a proof of these words, notice how coolcryptid have gotten back at hiticon after the liar doc was released, mocking his previous words:</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/umkjDeQXu_-826.avif 826w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/umkjDeQXu_-826.webp 826w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/umkjDeQXu_-826.jpeg" width="826" height="706"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>What hiticon said on the other hand is nothing out of ordinary for anyone having experience in moderation.

It’s also pretty ironic that with the linked doc they indeed did prove that people can’t really read — but in this case it’s not really the people to blame, since they got fooled by savetitanfall.com team who abused their trust in order to start their witch hunt.</p><p>This didn’t end here though.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/s1b7LjcD8M-912.avif 912w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/s1b7LjcD8M-912.webp 912w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/s1b7LjcD8M-912.jpeg" width="912" height="499"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The comment was since deleted, even before coolcryptid has deleted his whole reddit account.</p><p>Let’s comment on the words related to hiticonic here out of this stream of manipulation:</p><ul><li>“<em>his unwillingness to provide more information to people in this sub</em>” is not accurate, the intention was quite the opposite — to get people looking for what’s going on quickly up to speed and supply them with information on what’s currently going on</li><li>“<em>his removal of all posts mentioning savetitanfall from the front page</em>” — notice the wording, and how “from the front page” was inserted just at the end. The intention was to suggest that the posts were completely removed, while in fact they remained intact and simply got unpinned to make a place for the new one (limit of the pinned posts is just 2 by the way).</li><li>“<em>he talked shit about how much he hates the people on this sub</em>” — the precise words were “I hate this sub”, and they were said as a comment on a screenshot of a certain thing getting 10 times more upvotes than the real thing, something that is illogical and kind of saddening, and yet happens many times, stealing the original author out of their karma</li><li>“<em>how much he hates Titanfall 2</em>” — as one of Titanfall 1 OGs, he doesn’t really enjoy Titanfall 2 as much as he did 1, it’s not something that strange. But as that claim wasn’t convincing enough, it was later changed to claiming he just hated Titanfall, its community and everything about it in general, which is clearly not true. Why else would he moderate the sub and stay in the community throughout all these years if this was the case? Why else would he create <a href="http://wiki.frontier.tf.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html">a whole wiki about Titanfalls</a> (presently archived and in read-only mode)? Believe it or not, he was invited to the hidden TFO project’s channels exactly because of his long-lasting dedication for Titanfall.</li><li>“<em>He even asked for p0358 to kill it.</em>” — as mentioned in the “evidence section”, it was merely just a joke. The next sentence there suggests that as being part of the evidence of p0358 supposedly “killing the game” instead of fixing it. It’s another manipulation, since even if this “plea” wasn’t a joke, it still would not be a proof of such in any way, and suggesting so is a very twisted logic. It’s like if you just asked someone for feet pics and later claimed they’re a feet pic sender, even if they didn’t send you any pics at all and called it gross — it just doesn’t make any sense at all.</li></ul><p>He later proceeds to again accuse everyone of every wrongdoing they could possibly be accused of, proceeding to project the two out-of-context hiticonic’s messages into portraying him as some kind of ultimate saboteur and malcontent.</p><p>And his action did succeed, hiticonic ended up getting removed as the subreddit moderator, and the other mods fell for some of these lies.

Which by the way wanderer really wanted to convince people there was, by even telling to those who ignored the warning and launched the game that they now probably already have a RAT on their PC — despite the username payload clearly not being anything that tries to exploit an RCE vulnerability<strong>*</strong>.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/YY0mGv4MIw-339.avif 339w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/YY0mGv4MIw-339.webp 339w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/YY0mGv4MIw-339.jpeg" width="339" height="135"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/XK6OMkQZ27-504.avif 504w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/XK6OMkQZ27-504.webp 504w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/XK6OMkQZ27-504.jpeg" width="504" height="156"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>But he did see that the name had nothing resembling a shellcode?

Even if the RCE did somehow happen on the console, considering its architectural and software differences, it would be entirely useless to the potential attacker.</p><p>Furthermore, the exploit only happened if someone entered the lobby screen with community features enabled, and as it turned out it only happened in the biggest game networks. Without knowing that the safe bet is to not enter the multiplayer at all. But why in the world would someone tell people to uninstall the game completely? There is zero reasoning that could justify that. Even going to the single player games would have been perfectly safe. But how could someone abuse an RCE vulnerability in a code that’s not even running, if the game is not even launched?</p><p>The people who portray themselves as some kind of saviors, judges and executioners at the same time tell people to uninstall their game, and people on Reddit and Twitter blindly follow it without any questions asked. It cannot be described with words.</p><p><strong>*</strong> Because the whole payload in its first version was just a full version of the racist copy-pasta that Jeanue used for his long usernames back in 2018-2019, don’t tell me random readable alphabetical characters are valid processor instructions, because they are not, both us and wanderer realize that.</p><p>However, the interesting thing about that situation and confirming that Jeanue was still the one behind the attack, was the event in which MrSteyk has checked the Origin account ID of the account performing the attack and sent a friend request to it. Promptly after that happened, the payload has been switched to the same payload that was used by Jeanue in 2019 to crash Titanfall 1 games. This reference was not random — MrSteyk is the one who designed a client-side patch back then to the exact Titanfall 1 vulnerability that was abused by this payload. Thus the switch of the payload after the friend request was sent, was a mockery on MrSteyk by Jeanue. A mockery that also did prove once again that it’s the same Jeanue behind the attacks as years ago.</p><p>But it’s again one of the things NoSkill wasn’t aware of, since it’s not something you will find on the first page of google search results, and that’s how deep their research was usually going before drawing their conclusions.</p><p>A little cherry on top:</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/m5QFULYXhg-298.avif 298w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/m5QFULYXhg-298.webp 298w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/m5QFULYXhg-298.jpeg" width="298" height="369"></picture><figcaption>Everything they could to get as many people as possible to uninstall the game and cease playing it or what?</figcaption></figure><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/tE3YF4dyDD-405.avif 405w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/tE3YF4dyDD-405.webp 405w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/tE3YF4dyDD-405.jpeg" width="405" height="461"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Surprisingly aggressive words towards Ryan Rigney must have been related to that tweet of him, given that was the only tweet he sent around that time:</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/LQ-rz03FLV-594.avif 594w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/LQ-rz03FLV-594.webp 594w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/LQ-rz03FLV-594.jpeg" width="594" height="402"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Hate him or love him, but he is spitting straight facts here.

One of his exploits that he shared ended up rendering the 2018's version of Counter-Strike globally in the same state as Titanfall was rendered by jeanue.</p><p>Isn’t that ironic that they accuse people who tried to help Titanfalls in any way of attacking the game, while at the same time cooperating with a person like this? Or perhaps more concerning than ironic, given their calls to uninstall the game they supposedly wanted to “save”?</p><p>Wanderer was given a big level of insight into their actions, and NoSkill has shared with him much more than they have included in the public report.</p><p>His mention of the harsh betrayal over the leak is also highly ironic, given he leaked TFO revival project’s source code after being persuaded to it by SaveTitanfall.com team, which their whole group found funny.</p><p>You may ask though… wait a second, how did he even have access to that source code in the first place? Well, he did appear in Remnant Fleet out of nowhere and started talking of the exploits and ended up getting accepted into the project in order to help patch the exploits, so that they cannot be abused at least on the community servers, if Respawn cannot be gotten to fix it on the official ones.</p><p>However, one thing that seemed weird is how he was able to replicate what jeanue did in Titanfall, but in Counter-Strike. He did stream in the public voice chat one time, showing the attack, and the effect of players suddenly freezing was the exact same.</p><p>And despite them being aware of all these things, it didn’t stop NoSkill from closely cooperating with wanderer at any point, and even playing some games together for chill while the mass panic situation over Titanfall 2 that they created was unfolding:</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/mf1lQ5bHA0-579.avif 579w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/mf1lQ5bHA0-579.webp 579w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/mf1lQ5bHA0-579.jpeg" width="579" height="416"></picture><figcaption>NoSkill moderation doesn’t mind sketchy hackers and cheaters presence at all. It’s only a problem if someone else speaks with a hacker. But not them.</figcaption></figure><p>It’s worth to note that there are more screenshots where wanderer was discussing the mentioned vulnerability that has similar symptoms to the vulnerability that Jeanue uses in Titanfalls to lag the players and drop them from the server. We are not sharing them here, because they go into technical details that could allow others to easily reproduce them, and we aren’t going to drop them publicly like NoSkill, because we still do care about this game and don’t want to worsen its state even further. Contrary to what they want you to believe.</p><p><strong>And indeed, in October 2021 he was found to be actively attacking Titanfall 2 servers and bragging about it.</strong></p><p>This action got him banned on NoSkill, after which he proceeded to spam the invite link to that server in game networks, later faking his name to “p0358” and spamming the link to Remnant Fleet.</p><p>Who knows then, given how here he seems to have played on both sides, if he wasn’t helping jeanue himself attack the game with those exploits? It is pure speculation, but one thing’s for sure — this guy is sketchy. At the same time, the people behind the RedTape doc cooperated with him closely, without seeing any problem in that.</p><p>This is what happened in October:</p><figure><picture><source

This is not hard to do and there are multiple methods anyone can do it, from dumping strings from the library by <a href="https://pastebin.com/raw/3DSCK09f">finding a dump on the internet</a> to just using the Icepick modding tool that enables an in-game console. And he did notice that a ConVar named “matchmaking_hostname” exists. Which was not a secret knowledge in the first, since some people were changing this ConVar already in the past to play on dev servers, which were free of attacks at that time.</p><p>He noticed that the value of it is the domain “r2-pc.stryder.respawn.com”. So seeing “pc” in there, he tried inserting “ps4” in its place and checked if such subdomain also exists. To no surprise, it did. Thus he shared his wonder if it could be used to play on PS4 servers. That’s it. That’s literally all he did.</p><p>They have accused him of having admin access to Stryder, of “finding exploit that took PS4 down” and of supplying Jeanue with supposed information on how to take down PS4, their proof being that PS4 simply went down at similar time back then.</p><p><strong>This just once again proves how they have zero clue what they’re talking about. Zero.</strong> Obviously the existence of multiple Stryder subdomains for all platforms was a painfully common and obvious knowledge for anyone reverse engineering that game, and possessing such knowledge means nothing on its own. Unless you want to say that just because someone knows a domain “www.google.com” exists, means they hacked Google. Pretty ridiculous, isn’t it? And the existence of those subdomains was always obvious to Jeanue as well, because it really doesn’t take a genius to think of supplying “ps4” in place of “pc”.</p><p>The mention of “wall hack” refers to an old incident where Taskinoz found a dev feature in game that shows player names above their heads or something like that. He immediately shared his findings on Discord being excited about the discovery, without first thinking through that these names are always visible no matter whether a player is visible on screen or no, making it a kind practically of half-assed wallhack. Wanty, a then-admin, has noticed that and immediately removed that message, giving Taskinoz a warning. People make mistakes, but they now felt the need to bring that back and suggest he’s a malicious cheater based on that, also mentioning “more shady practices” without further elaborating on that.</p><p>It is pretty sad, because Taskinoz was yet another person who did try to help this community to the extent he could. He is the author of the “streamer mode” for Titanfall 2 that did hide all player names in the game, making it much harder for attackers to track down the game that is being by a streamer and the account that they use. And it’s another person that was played by NoSkill and accused of being a Jeanue helper, based purely on their delusion.</p><p>The second person mentioned is Vitalised. No wonder he also became the target, given how he didn’t hesitate to make jokes of their ridiculous accusations. But what did he do?</p><p>For little context, we need to talk about dev servers in Titanfall 2. It was found out once upon a time that a separate realm of servers hosted on a separate Stryder instance exist. They were free of Jeanue attacks at the time, and thus many people have played on them. The separation meant that the player persistent storage (where your level, generations, inventory, everything about the player) was obviously also separate.</p><p>But there was one big problem. In order to decrease the traffic and reliance on the main storage services, the servers do transfer player storage directly to the new server when a player joins a new servers from the old one, for example when entering or leaving a match. The problem was, if someone accepted an invite to a new server while being on a dev server, the clean profile from the dev storage would get transferred to the public server, and later override the existing storage from the public realm. In other words, if you accidentally accepted such an invite, your account would basically be reset.</p><p>And there was another thing: dev servers had Source engine’s “sv_cheats” convar enabled, and allowed anyone to execute any script. And Vitalised did use that loophole in order to restore the generations for some people who desperately begged for that.</p><p>Little did he know, you’re apparently not supposed to help anyone in this community, and thus he became another target, apparently being another evil mercenary with admin access on Stryder. Obviously he did, given Taskinoz was lambasted for simply noticing a domain name used by the game. It’s logical the self-righteous self-proclaimed judges would not let Vitalised’s act go unnoticed.</p><p>These two events have led a few content creators to dispute what was going on, seeing how NoSkill and iiishiii behave from front seats, ending up in them getting removed from CC and a drama being started there. Because one is not supposed to dispute iiishiii’s words. It’s a lack of respect to not agree with everything she says and pat her on the back no matter her actions.</p><p>Furthermore, Vitalised spreading false claims of them doxxing people? Did you see in the section above that they literally shared MrSteyk’s real name*? Nonetheless, this conversation is one of the things the claim was probably based on:</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/u6vxn7EfGn-968.avif 968w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/u6vxn7EfGn-968.webp 968w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/u6vxn7EfGn-968.jpeg" width="968" height="423"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>The big irony of them doxxing people is how they always proclaimed to be against any kind of doxxing and harassment. They always criticized actions of anyone who tried to say anything wrong to real Jeanue, underlining they can’t know for sure if it’s them. But now suddenly they’re sure? They’re against harassment, but they started the biggest witch hunt the Titanfall community has ever seen? The level of their hypocrisy is really just hard to comprehend.</p><p>* To be fully honest though, at least this name was censored when shared publicly.</p><h2 id="the-cult-of-iiishiii-shameless-lies-manipulations-and-deception">The cult of iiishiii.

She goes as far as to claim that she doesn’t care about a person’s actions at all, in this case of p0358. Honestly this is pretty insane. Requesting to put her name on a document for credibility and some attention, but not even caring if anything stated in it is correct at all?</p><p>Another thing needs to be cleared up here. iiishiii did not personally speak to p0358 after the Apex attack happened at all (she did however remove some of the messages from the private message channel with him in order to make some messages look very out of place). It does remain a fact that p0358 and RedShield had nothing to do with the Apex attack and learnt of it after it was already happening — exactly the same as you did.</p><p>However, you seem to have forgotten about this conversation from Creator Circuit server:</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/ykRf1hjZcS-300.avif 300w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/ykRf1hjZcS-300.webp 300w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/ykRf1hjZcS-300.jpeg" width="300" height="579"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>You did not want to know who the attackers were in the first place. You were informed that it’s known who they are per your own request, right on the spot. Why now claim that anyone did lie to you?</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/0StBhTLqsY-605.avif 605w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/0StBhTLqsY-605.webp 605w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/0StBhTLqsY-605.jpeg" width="605" height="183"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Again, she underlines she does not care to know what is the truth. She always has her own “truth” and seems that she will do everything to prove to be right.</p><p>How did p0 play you, where did he lie, why is that not mentioned? Again, mentioning that supposedly people in CC were mad at him for “things he said”. What were those things? Why was it never brought up or mentioned to him or on the server? Why were these supposed concerns never cleared up, not even a slight suggestion given anywhere, if there really was any problem?</p><p>Unless by “in this server” you meant Remnant Fleet and the document. Then you very well knew what you’re doing. Putting sensational captions, cropping the out-of-context screenshots even more out of context and mislabeling them. Playing on emotions by including some bullshit stories of 6 years old kids crying unable to play and the like (besides, what kind of parent allows such kids to play games like that). To be clear, we do understand the situation in these games is impacting to people. But to throw all of that onto us was just nothing else than a low emotional manipulation. Should we really bring up then the hundreds of messages telling us to kill ourselves and the like that we received as a direct result of your actions?</p><p>The twist and volume of the RedTape report’s screenshots was so big that not many people have even reviewed them in the first place either way. They instead got mad at what YOU have told them about them. At what YOU claimed in the introduction to the document, allegations that found no backing in the screenshots whatsoever. Trusting that what was said is truth — it has to be if it’s backed by such “reputable” and “respected” members of the community, right? You would not fool everyone, including Respawn by sending them fake information, right? Counting that they can be sued to laugh at them and even claiming that “extradition process is almost finalized” at some point? You realize that slander is a serious crime, had someone been to end up in court because of your lies?</p><p>Yes, you do have a screenshot of him saying “trolling streamers would be interesting xd”. You didn’t care to think of the timeframe it was posted at. How could someone know months before how this would age for Titanfall 2 community? Obviously nobody could. Why do you even assume “trolling” equals “not allowing any single streamer to play a particular game for months” in the first place?</p><p>Maybe you don’t realize, but “trolling streamers” for normal people means stuff like this (which are just simply funny for everyone, including the streamer): <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI0H9f6J9hY">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wI0H9f6J9hY</a></p><p>Why always assume and want the worst possible? It’s not healthy.</p><p>Also, iiishiii has a very weird definition of respect. Apparently having a different opinion or questions on the Creator Circuit is disrespectful, even if you’re not attacking or insulting anyone. But saying “fuck You” seems perfectly respectful, since “You” was written with the capital letter after all, right?</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/mJnLDJKC5Y-617.avif 617w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/mJnLDJKC5Y-617.webp 617w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/mJnLDJKC5Y-617.jpeg" width="617" height="327"></picture><figcaption>Ignore “bad resolve” here, it’s wanderer’s alt account spreading misinformation.</figcaption></figure><p>Oh, is that so? Then why didn’t you use that time to verify your information? To ask yourself if you’re correct at all? To try to understand the meaning of the messages you were looking at, at all? Why didn’t you ask anyone involved if you didn’t? Well, it seems that because you did WANT these things to be true. Such a simple explanation to everything, the least complicated. Let’s just lambast innocent people, because it’d be convenient if this was them, right? But don’t look into the materials too much, don’t try asking anyone about the things you don’t understand, because of the subconscious fear that it might turn out it’s not right. And you’d again have no trail. Just like we don’t really have much trail of the real attackers. But it was convenient to think it could be this easy to find them.</p><p>You got so many screenshots of us, because we never really did anything wrong in the first place. We had no reason to hide or feel any shame. We were the transparent ones all along the way. Yes, except of not throwing the Russian hackers right in the mouths of tens of thousands of hungry sharks on the Apex hack day. But you knew that. They never really tried to hide it too much either. You wanted to expose them for that? Sure, the doc could have been max 5 pages long. Even though the screenshots that you have shown actually didn’t prove they did it either. But they did confess to it. Because they’re honest. And you didn’t want to understand any of these screenshots and conversations in the first place.</p><p>You, on the other hand, in your “transparency” have missed how Wanty was persuading p0358 to actually kill Titanfall 1 on Xbox One forever, unironically. And what was his excuse at that time — to “test us”, “see if we were really telling the truth”? Yes, p0358 always knew what Jeanue was missing to attack Xbox One. And he protected this knowledge so much, he never mentioned anything even in the trusted channels. If he wasn’t this careful, Xbox One would be a dead platform for Titanfall 1 now. And what would Wanty tell these people? That he wanted to test if a gun can shoot? That they’d from now on NEVER play their favorite game? Because he wanted to carelessly test something? And doom their game forever in the process?</p><blockquote><em>Why do you look at the speck in your brother’s eye, but fail to notice the beam in your own eye?</em></blockquote><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/sj-mPvV2Kr-616.avif 616w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/sj-mPvV2Kr-616.webp 616w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/sj-mPvV2Kr-616.jpeg" width="616" height="465"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>But an attempt of any explanation is unsurprisingly met with an immediate “Cya”.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/BGd1q5PPp8-621.avif 621w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/BGd1q5PPp8-621.webp 621w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/BGd1q5PPp8-621.jpeg" width="621" height="387"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Just as usual using some mystic words with zero concretes. “You bad, me good, bye”.</p><p><strong>p0358:</strong> You know what?

Do not be surprised that more and more people around you have started seeing what are you doing.</p><p>Let’s take a look back at some messages in Creator Circuit:</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/00S8ARFp_h-1493.avif 1493w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/00S8ARFp_h-1493.webp 1493w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/00S8ARFp_h-1493.jpeg" width="1493" height="627"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Again, baseless claims of lies, even though everything that was said was true, including the things that were shared during the very first convo with Shiring. You never presented any arguments as to why would you believe any of that info was wrong. We would like to hear that. Calling suspect’s ex who says she knows nothing and to piss off does not refute or explain the direct connections described in the Jeanue section in any way.</p><p>It seems that further on, the mismatch between the time spent on Titanfall by p0358 and alleged lack of care didn’t tick anything. It’s followed by a further conspiracy on the timing. But the explanation for that part was simple. p0358 wanted to finish that article that he was procrastinating on for a long time, to release it before he goes on holidays, of which he told everyone, and you were aware as well. Figuring out that if the article gets released beforehand, the game could get fixed two weeks earlier. Of course it did not age well, since you created a whole hell in this community, and Respawn decided to ignore the article altogether. But none of this could have been predicted. He wanted to help and he naively counted that Respawn does want to finally fix Titanfalls after finally releasing <em>some</em> server update. You didn’t figure the vacation is also why he didn’t notice the lack of access to the server? Pretty limited reasoning for someone who claims to know everything and more than anyone else.</p><p>The google doc that you mention? The police packet that has all the personal information on Jeanue? It was indeed pretty bold to leak that, while claiming you’re all against doxxing and harassment, we gotta admit. The document was only ever shared to trusted parties, and you decided to drop it publicly. Thankfully the share link could be disabled afterwards. Because that information was only ever meant to be shared with authorities and Respawn/EA.</p><p>Also, speaking of “coincidences” in timing when mentioning things in range of weeks or months is pretty laughable. Though not surprising anymore after they lynched taskinoz, after he happened to mention PS4, and some time afterwards PS4 was attacked. Simply “irrefutable” proof. Tell you what, if you were the one to find out the situation about before-mentioned J.O. and how everything did align precisely against him, you’d probably hang him right on spot — and he did turn out to be innocent.</p><p>But let’s focus on the messages highlighted in blue, they sound pretty incriminating, don’t they? p0 not giving shit at all about Titanfall? Now let’s take a look at how this conversation really looked like:</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/3VyJEbKY6x-557.avif 557w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/3VyJEbKY6x-557.webp 557w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/3VyJEbKY6x-557.jpeg" width="557" height="927"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>So, p0358 did post a link to his article, right after publish, “everything on a plate”, all fixes.</p><p>But iiishiii… removed it. So p0358 responded sarcastically, “it doesn’t need to reach Respawn, Titanfall could always stay ddosed [if you want so] xd”, trying to question her intentions here — she supposedly wants the game to get fixed, <strong>so why in the world would she remove an article with list of fixes, one that’s supposed to finally accomplish exactly that goal?</strong></p><p>Then she follows with a picture of… what, confirming she’s purposefully harming herself as a Titanfall player by removing it? Everyone was confused about it. Though of course after some time the reason became apparent, they were already planning to frame him. The article instructing Respawn on how to fix the game was a clear threat to the community believing her lies, so it was unfavorable to let it spread — because why would someone who’s claimed to supposedly “want the game to die” write a guidance on how to fix it all?</p><p><strong>p0358:</strong> Yeah, I remember that after this occurrence. I worked on this article for a few nights and was so happy to finally share it, genuinely counting that after Respawn updated their servers first time in years, this might be the final solution to fix the jeanue situation, that this time will be different from before and that there is an actual chance they’ll implement the proper fixes. But I was met with the article being immediately removed and it felt like a punch to the face. I remember that after this bike picture was posted, I asked a few people what the fuck is going on in PM, because I genuinely didn’t understand what was going on, and nobody had a clue either. A discussion about the article was started some time later, after it was pasted by others enough that it wasn’t really viable to remove it and shut it down. Someone mentioned she’s probably afraid of IP grabbers, and I just went with that. It didn’t end up raising any red flags for me, iiishiii was frequently acting kinda weird, so I just forgot about it, I wasn’t one to hold some kind of grudges against people or judge their behavior. But well, little did I knew they were planning to frame me into being the attacker myself, lol…</p><p>Now having that explained, let us remind you of this quote once again:</p><blockquote>And p0 told me the day he published his fixes.,<br>Respawn didn’t have to see his fixes, TF2 could stay broken.<br>He didn’t give a shit at all.</blockquote><p>A shameless lie or a complete lack of understanding of written words? Really hard to tell what’s worse.</p><p>We mentioned how nobody was comfortable sharing any kind of disputing opinion in Creator Circuit or questioning anything iiishiii said or did. Let’s take a look why:</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/IW8H2OPdDC-1330.avif 1330w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/IW8H2OPdDC-1330.webp 1330w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/IW8H2OPdDC-1330.jpeg" width="1330" height="771"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/7gkUrzhW9F-875.avif 875w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/7gkUrzhW9F-875.webp 875w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/7gkUrzhW9F-875.jpeg" width="875" height="598"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Somebody disagreed on a productive discussion being shut down in the middle just because a “very scary” command prompt screenshot was posted. They were met with passive aggression and an immediate threat of removing them from the server. This is how stuff was handled in Creator Circuit under the command of iiishiii. The queen and the bees.</p><p>Let us continue. The following announcement was posted in September, after iiishiii re-joined Creator Circuit and before she has left it again:</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/5rYJJF-Mdw-1304.avif 1304w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/5rYJJF-Mdw-1304.webp 1304w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/5rYJJF-Mdw-1304.jpeg" width="1304" height="763"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>While we won’t comment on the drama and discussions from CC, because they do diverge from our situation, some things should be commented.</p><blockquote>Dragging people through the mud when they aren’t there to defend themselves.</blockquote><p>Bold words for someone who did exactly that. You did silently remove people from Remnant Fleet from Creator Circuit and then did proceed to shamelessly shit on them and lie about them, without them even knowing and being able to defend themselves. They were not running away from you like you were running away from them and everyone else — claiming you want to hear their side of the story, but leaving every time they tried to share it with you. You never gave them any chance to defend themselves, neither before or after “RedTape” was published. What you’re saying here is simply insolent. All that while talking something about respect. No, it is not respectful to spread lies about someone if you’re using polite (yet passive aggressive) words, let’s get this straight.</p><p>And again some mystic “truth” is being hidden. Perhaps it’s better it wasn’t shared, given what we’ve seen already before.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/6afVEFx0V7-1079.avif 1079w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/6afVEFx0V7-1079.webp 1079w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/6afVEFx0V7-1079.jpeg" width="1079" height="2143"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>See?

If you didn’t get the whole truth, you should have asked them about their opinion or perspective. But you did not. Because sadly the real reason they were kept on the server was to raise zero suspicion of the action you want to pull off, to let it have the biggest possible impact, when nobody expects it.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/l4Ne82Bw8U-1076.avif 1076w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/l4Ne82Bw8U-1076.webp 1076w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/l4Ne82Bw8U-1076.jpeg" width="1076" height="2138"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Wait a second… two screenshots above you just said that you’d do everything again and that you stand behind every decision. Here you say you wouldn’t agree to anything at all had you known the whole truth?</p><p>And yes, Wanty did have the access to Remnant Fleet channels as the only one back then. And it does seem he turned all of you against us. With how he kept repeating the community is looking at us, they look at what we’re saying, it just seems that he was envy of that — given Remnant Fleet had more members and spotlight, even if it was partly due to his decisions. But it seems that once Titanfall 2 started getting attacked, Titanfall 1 community and everything around it became an unneeded part of the chain and an unnecessary ballast.</p><p>But once again, you never questioned his claims, despite being aware there was some beef between the two servers, resulting in Remnant Fleet being excluded from SaveTitanfall.com project.</p><p>Also, you do admit the reasons you wanted your name to be put on their document in the first place.

But obviously the error message was the same as the one Jeanue’s attacks, because he was trying to replicate what he was doing and find out how. By the way, the messages around it were leaked by NoSkill, including how he did it. We nowadays do know that Jeanue was doing it some other way all along.</p><p>As for being told it’s Jeanue, obviously, even the attackers referred to themselves as “Jeanue”. All members of their group, because this is how they eventually became known and referred as. And this comes from the fact that other people were always changing their names, but the person named “jeanue” joined them on that fairly late, and was previously known for his cheating behavior (speedhacking + shittalking in lobbies). Not sure what “file” is referring to, so cannot comment on that.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/ID1UReY9cu-612.avif 612w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/ID1UReY9cu-612.webp 612w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/ID1UReY9cu-612.jpeg" width="612" height="1082"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>We have shown all the clues that justify the presence of 3 people.

And you just say it’s all wrong just because. It seems that you cannot dispute how connections around these people were found, because you understand none of that. You just shifted your belief towards distrust, because it’s what NoSkill told you, without understanding it themselves as well.

The only problem is, iiishiii isn’t able to handle or understand all of the information about it either! But convinces everyone including herself it seems that she is. And that’s a problem.</p><p>Now let’s comment on the “facts”:</p><ol><li>Maybe it is. You’re implying all “hackers” are the bad blackhats. Putting everyone here in one bag is not fair. Most of the modders fall under the definition of “hackers”. And Titanfall community really doesn’t have <em>that</em> many around it, compared with many other games.</li><li>I suppose this can be agreed with to a certain extent. But we really needn’t had to been put through all this drama by you.</li><li>You mean that video about Titanfall 1 attackers by UEG? No, he did start his lookout from within Creator Circuit. And what exactly you told him did influence his videos a lot, for example your strong belief of a conspiracy theory around Jeanue being a former Respawn worker. Get real, he wasn’t and Respawn just doesn’t care about Titanfall, there isn’t much more to it. The fact that he claimed so while trolling does not change that. All these conspiracy theories really aren’t helping with anything.</li><li>Good, there’s enough proof on it of our clean intentions. Just open your eyes instead of cherry-picking singular messages and refusing to look what’s around them.</li><li>Okay, and why would they? If they’re not stupid, they will see our innocence. But you threw at them all these fake leaks, and instead of just simply fixing the damn game, they have to spend all the resources on reviewing all this information. And such a work undoubtfully takes much more than if they simply fixed the bugs that are being exploited.</li><li>You seem to be connecting together a few distinct things here. Jeanue attacks? I think everyone was aware of them. If you mean how early we were made aware, people would simply send to us any anomalies they encountered in Titanfall 2 — some of which later did turn out to indeed be Jeanue testing his “toys”.<br>Completely separate is the stupid discussion about “what if” we took Titanfall 2 down to spread awareness about Titanfall 1 that RedShield was pushing, a discussion that wasn’t serious in the first place either. You completely missed that after thorough discussion of all arguments, it was deemed to be the most stupid thing that could have been done, that all the possible potential positives are just potential and heavily outweighed all the disadvantages that were brought up. After eventual backlash from literally everyone on that channel, including p0358, Red did step down from this idea, saying it’s out of question, not even as “plan B”, after which the thread died with a comment from p0358 that we should focus on some positive work instead.<br>All of this was already commented in the “evidence” response section.<br>Thing is — it was so stupid precisely because we were already doing early work on TFO back then. So it made ZERO sense to pull off extreme measures like that to bring awareness to Titanfall 1 and get Respawn to fix it, while we were in the process of making something superior to it and DID NOT NEED it in the first place. So why in the world did Red bring this up at all? We don’t know what.<br>It does seem that the lack of sense around it made NoSkill assume it was about TFO, but it was not. In the discussion it was specifically mentioned that doing something like that would be the single worst possible thing to do while being the people behind such a project as well.<br>And basically with all of us saying how terrible of an idea it would be eventually to do something like this, they somehow claimed that we “wanted” to do something like this.<br>Reading comprehension skills are clearly lacking on your side.</li></ol><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/V4RnW_8ggd-687.avif 687w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/V4RnW_8ggd-687.webp 687w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/V4RnW_8ggd-687.jpeg" width="687" height="606"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>“What does that tell me?” — nothing.

But it doesn’t add to your agenda, so you ignore it. Fact is that Jeanue was finding people through pattern matching and checking which players meet all the conditions, which only left him eventually with one possibility — and it wasn’t a rocket science to figure out for anyone with a brain. This is simply literally the only method he could have used for that.</p><blockquote>Now, to answer the specific question: what do you have if anything to prove it’s p0 or whoever?</blockquote><p>Glad that you mentioned that, too bad you forgot to answer this question at all.</p><p>That’s a typical manipulative technique that politicians love to use — if someone asks a question, pretend that you’re about to respond to it, but talk about something entirely irrelevant, avoiding answering the question itself in any way, overload the other party with many words, and leave them uncertain on whether any answer was actually given. In this case, a total shift from the question to some cheap play on emotions.</p><blockquote>Think for yourselves. Form your own opinions. Just, be careful.</blockquote><p>Be careful — because if your opinion isn’t “valid” and in line with what it <em>should</em> be right now, you will risk being removed from that discord server?</p><p>As of that conversation with jeanue on the screenshot, seriously? xD Jeanue asking p0358 about something is a proof p0358 did anything?</p><p>There was a question from Jeanue about blacklist interjected between p0 responding to the claim of 3 accounts. Nowhere in that screenshot is a response to the blacklisting question that iiishiii has claimed there is. Seriously that’s all the base of your claims? This is either a lack of basic reading skills or just a lie.</p><p>It’s normal in a conversation with someone that people split their thoughts into multiple messages and thus a new message can be injected in between messages relating to something else. Most people who ever conversated online should be well aware of it.</p><p><strong>p0358:</strong> If you cared to look around at all, the conversation at that point was about one of the cheaters who was proud of his acts enough to brag about his cheating on a YouTube channel with his real name and to also share those videos later on his Facebook account. And I never hid the fact that I used to mess with some cheaters in-game back in 2018, to stop them from messing up the game for others and making regular players quit, and maintained a list of known cheaters along with their usernames, user IDs and links to the evidence of cheating. A questionable act, perhaps, but I did this because I didn’t want Titanfall 1 to die. And its population did start to decline rapidly due to the rise of those cheaters, when there was nowhere else to go to avoid them.</p><p>Also…</p><blockquote>jeanue questions p0's actions</blockquote><p>Perhaps he did that. He’s one of the cheaters after all. Definitely won’t appreciate that someone is trying to get rid of the likes of him. Good to know you’re vouching for cheaters' free hand, then, if you bring this up?</p><blockquote>The sensitive information you request, <em>much of that</em> directly supports this.</blockquote><p>Oh yes, in that conversation file there were even more misunderstandings about its contents, coolcryptid did later shed some light on one of them and how your group understood it. Basically p0358 was mocking jeanue for his complete inability to even make a proper HTTP request to the point jeanue left the server out of frustration, which they claimed was “p0358 helping jeanue”. The “REDACTED” sensitive requests mentioned were simply the requests that the game literally makes every time you press the “PLAY” button on the main menu. And his inability to even reproduce such a request was simply laughable. Perhaps you could know this if you asked someone competent about it, but all of those were distrusted as “hackers” after all…</p><p>Now if all these public lies weren’t enough, iiishiii, as we mentioned, was engaging numerous times in spreading lies about us in private, where it was harder to be questioned by the witnesses:</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/Qto56hIgB3-750.avif 750w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/Qto56hIgB3-750.webp 750w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/Qto56hIgB3-750.jpeg" width="750" height="1280"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Blaming “tufi” on hacks was a meme, it was always obvious for everyone. Tufi himself used to even encourage attributing various hacks to him.</p><p>Now the claims about p0358…</p><p><strong>p0358: </strong>Hating Gaze and Vitalised, seriously? xD Perhaps you’re projecting your own feelings towards them on others. I didn’t even know or hear of Vitalised ever before that drama, nor did he know about me, first time we spoke was after you disowned him for a set of lies against him. I guess congratulations on uniting the community? But it was most likely a manipulative act meant to discourage them from talking to me — because one might accidentally get the whole picture and form their actual own opinion by talking to both sides. 🙊</p><p>It’s pretty ironic that this is carried out by one of the authors of a “transparency” document.</p><p>The amount of misinformation and manipulations presented by iiishiii so far is deemed enough, if we were to paste and comment on every single lie, it would take half of the document.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/i42fEbEj4--927.avif 927w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/i42fEbEj4--927.webp 927w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/i42fEbEj4--927.jpeg" width="927" height="668"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>She was also well aware of the p0358's vacation all the time and laughed about it, when p0358 had to sit at his room with a laptop and tried to understand what is going on and respond to people instead of sitting at the beach, ending up with a fever from the whole situation.

Coolcryptid has before deleted all his reddit comments around the situation, now he deleted his whole account and wiped discord DMs.</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/zOCVrSkh-9-920.avif 920w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/zOCVrSkh-9-920.webp 920w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/zOCVrSkh-9-920.jpeg" width="920" height="574"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p><strong>The savetitanfall.com website has been completely taken down as well</strong> (by the way, is DirectXeon silently suggesting the document that was also shared there isn’t really valid?)</p><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/NC9WqQ_W_a-820.avif 820w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/NC9WqQ_W_a-820.webp 820w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/NC9WqQ_W_a-820.jpeg" width="820" height="155"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/KlGet6NIn7-720.avif 720w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/KlGet6NIn7-720.webp 720w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/KlGet6NIn7-720.jpeg" width="720" height="999"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><figure><picture><source type="image/avif" srcset="/static/img/vKdzVRVHzk-822.avif 822w"><source type="image/webp" srcset="/static/img/vKdzVRVHzk-822.webp 822w"><img alt="" loading="lazy" decoding="async" src="/static/img/vKdzVRVHzk-822.jpeg" width="822" height="716"></picture><figcaption></figcaption></figure><p>Interestingly enough, all the announcements Wanty has made related to the situation, including his attribution to the screenshots showing his sins and including his “transparency package” with all the messages, are also gone from NoSkill’s announcements channel — though to be fair that package itself was also a privacy violation for many people involved and shouldn’t had been shared in the first place.</p><p>Nobody however has the courage and dignity to admit they were wrong and apologize to those who were slandered and wronged by them.</p><p>There’s also the last person remaining — iiishiii — who on the other hand just pretends to be done with everything. Her “I’m out” has become a catch phrase at this point. But these actions are meant to just deceive people. To be able to trash-talk people from the backseat and continue all her actions, playing the first fiddle, but try to avoid any responsibility should they end up getting exposed for all their wrongdoing (which this document tries to achieve). She passed the ownership of Creator Circuit to someone else, but tries to do a backseat moderation on it at the same time and then even demanded its deletion, and is trying to turn everyone against her targets silently in private messages. Everything she says at this point is one big deception. And it sadly seems unlikely to change, so long as people will support her in that and let her stay in her bubble of delusion.</p><h1 id="summary">Summary</h1><p>The authors of the RedTape document, through their reckless, irresponsible behavior, have created an unbelievable soap opera via their sheer ignorance. While trying to claim some mantle of unifying the community against the “bad guys”, they’ve done more damage than the bad guy himself in many ways. We can promise you that when RedTape dropped and the real Jeanue was seeing the fallout within the community — he was gloating big time.</p><p>Virtually every single claim NoSkill / RedTape have made has been false.

Well iiish, we’re really glad you asked actually, because we can answer that question. Precisely when you and your crew, via a lack of understanding, began accusing innocent modders left and right of being Jeanue and publishing false, extremely divisive, inflammatory reports. And rather than admit your mistake, you all followed that up with digging your heels in and continuing to point fingers, kick everyone from your servers for asinine reasons, and claim you have more evidence that will never see the light of day.</p><p>Your self-rightousness was impossible to be disputed by anyone. Those who tried to disagree or shared their doubts were threatened and bashed by the hivemind, being left with no choice but to stay silent, and those who refused to shut up and bow to your command ended up getting publicly lambasted, and you always did your best to turn everyone against them. “You’re 100% with us or you’re our enemy.”</p><p>You were acting like some self-proclaimed judges who possess the ultimate knowledge on everything that nobody else can understand, but in fact you were the ones who understood nothing. Your “evidence” was all based on a total lack of understanding and the will to understand, on taking even the most obvious jokes and sarcasm literally, on twisting people’s words in a desperate attempt of seeing wrong intentions where there were no wrong intentions.</p><p>You dismissed months if not years of work of many people in this community just like that, it all meant nothing to you. At the same time you have the audacity to teach others about respect to people, while by lack of respect you mean merely disagreeing with your actions. While you didn’t hesitate in the slightest to start the biggest witch hunt and organized harassment the Titanfall community has ever seen in its history, against innocent people.</p><p>You did not care about the truth at all. You picked a thesis and tried to do everything to prove it against the facts. Aggressively rejecting any contrary opinions, because finding out what is the reality was not your goal. Acting completely insane.</p><p>And what was the goal? A mere chance you’d be right and it’d work? And for that to throw innocent people under the bus? While the real attackers only became more confident in their actions, with the whole blame shifted to exactly those who tried to defeat them.</p><p>It’s really high time we speak up against all of that.</p><p>So much for “SaveTitanfall”.</p><p><strong>Wanty</strong>, <strong>coolcryptid</strong>, <strong>DirectXeon</strong>, <strong>iiishiii </strong>— you should be ashamed of yourselves.</p><h1 id="closing-words-to-the-community">Closing words to the community</h1><p>As many have said, the community was tricked and lied to, indeed. But the other way around than they thought.</p><p>Those who claimed to present the ultimate reveal of the villains, did in fact lynch innocent people (those who did actually try to help Titanfall, to make things worse), and simply lied and made everything up (being only <em>partially</em> right about Apex hack, but also being a part of it no less than those whom they accused at the same time).</p><p>The community and the games of Titanfall have sustained major damage. With the absence of action from the game developers, people have jumped to their own throats. All while the real attackers had the laugh of their lifetime.</p><p>Nonetheless, after clearing stuff up, we hope we can eventually leave this drama behind. We did what was in our power to explain the content that was presented to everyone as “evidence”, but that was for the most part simply unrelated or even a proof of actual innocence.</p><p>We hope this could be a lesson for people on thinking critically, be more careful with drawing conclusions based on pure intuition or what they just want to believe instead of facts.</p><p>If you still think we did harm the Titanfall games in any way after this, there is probably no saving for you. But we do hope we managed to explain what was happening in the last three years and what was just our part in trying to improve the situation of our favorite game.</p><p>If this still hasn’t been stressed enough, <strong>Titanfall Online had nothing to do with it, their conspiracy theory around it is 100% false.</strong></p><p>It is very sad that they so carelessly wanted to throw the months of work put on this project out of the boat for their own gain, truly disappointing.</p><p>But even though the community has been put at war and our reputation has been punctured, we hope the harmony can still be restored and the trust regained.</p><p>This is why we are starting <strong>a new modding-oriented Discord server for Titanfall</strong> — named Harmony.</p><p>In the Titanfall lore, Harmony is a planet that is home to the headquarters of Militia, a resistance organization formed to defend The Frontier against the greedy and evil corporation of IMC.</p><blockquote><em>This is our land and we will fight for it!</em><br>— James MacAllan</blockquote><p><strong>Join us at Harmony Discord:</strong> <a href="http://discord.harmony.tf/">discord.harmony.tf</a></p><p>We would also like to thank everyone who has supported us throughout all of this.</p></article></main><button class="toc-toggle toc-toggle--inactive" aria-label="Toggle table of contents"><svg class="toc-toggle__closed" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><line x1="0" y1="4" x2="24" y2="4" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="4"/><line x1="0" y1="12" x2="24" y2="12" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="4"/><line x1="0" y1="20" x2="24" y2="20" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="4"/></svg> <svg class="toc-toggle__opened" width="24" height="24" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg"><path d="M1.5 1.5L22.5 22.5M1.5 22.5L22.5 1.5" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="4"/></svg></button></body></html>
